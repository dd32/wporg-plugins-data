Turns out everyone!<\/p>\n<p>We know that you and your users don\u2019t want to have to navigate ads and worry about the way your personal data is being handled, so we built a comment system with a difference.<\/p>\n<p>All we\u2019re focused on is making sure those all-important little comments get to where they need to go, and nothing else. That means we never monetize data, take over links, or track who\u2019s doing what.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re built and hosted in the UK, fully secured, and encrypted. Not only that, if you want to know how we use the tiny amount of data we do collect, all you have to do is ask.<\/p>\n<h4>Lightweight: Built For Speed<\/h4>\n<p>Fast page loading means happy visitors, and happy visitors mean more customers.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we made ReplyBox just 17 KB so that we\u2019re super fast, lightweight and truly agile when you compare us to any other comment system. Perfect for when you want Google to notice that you\u2019ve sped up your game and you\u2019re worthy of jumping up their rankings.<\/p>\n<p>And Disqus? It\u2019s nearly 30 times heavier than we are.<\/p>\n<h4>We Always Look the Part<\/h4>\n<p>We made ReplyBox so that it\u2019s modern, minimalist and mobile friendly from the moment you get started.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<p>ReplyBox is all about making life simpler, so we added everything you need and nothing more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Goodbye Spam:<\/strong> We use Akismet and a few other bright ideas to keep the spammers on the sidelines where they belong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instant Moderation:<\/strong> Control all new comments with a manual approval system that\u2019s simple and effective.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Markdown Formatting:<\/strong> Links, lists, quotes, code blocks and even your favorite emojis are all welcome here \ud83d\udcaa<\/p>\n<p><strong>Natural Discussion:<\/strong> We\u2019ve added nested comments so your users can reply direct to any comment they like and share their bright ideas.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always in the Loop:<\/strong> Anyone can subscribe to email notifications in an instant so that a reply or comment is never missed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social Login:<\/strong> Make commenting even easier by authenticating via Google in just two clicks (Twitter and the rest coming soon).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Work Wonders With WordPress:<\/strong> Import existing comments and sync everything without ever having to lift a finger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Custom CSS:<\/strong> Use CSS to transform ReplyBox into the on-brand addition your business has been waiting for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Webhooks:<\/strong> Notify external services that new comments have been added and streamline your workflow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pin a Comment:<\/strong> Highlight a bright idea or spark of inspiration with the click of a button so you never lose it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Emoji Reactions (coming soon):<\/strong> Sometimes all you need is a simple \ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\ude0d, so we\u2019re adding it for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>More Design Options (coming soon):<\/strong> Our designers are hard at work putting the finishing touches to even more ways to turn on the style.<\/p>\n<h4>Plugin Features<\/h4>\n<p>Our WordPress plugin means you get ReplyBox without having to do a thing.
