A confirmation email will be sent to you and the volunteer once they sign up. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Control the number of signups available for opportunities \u2013<\/strong> Only need 10 people to help out at an event? Set a cap on the number of people who can sign up. Want as many volunteers as you can get? No problem. You don\u2019t have to set a limit.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Send reminder emails anytime \u2013<\/strong> Schedule an automated reminder email a few days in advance or send a one-off email with last-minute details.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Volunteer profiles that track participation and more \u2013<\/strong> Keep track of all of your volunteers\u2019 involvement.

Some of them that were suggested over 4 years ago have not been added, despite the author acknowledging their usefulness and were \"high on our radar\".\nI expect I'll be referred to other plugins as other reviewers were, so this review is mostly to alert potential users to this plugin's important shortcomings, rather than a [likely] fruitless appeal to disinterested devs.\n\nOne of the missing features is a time slot selector for the volunteer to choose their desired time of service.  Going hand in hand with this would be specificity in the volunteer limit \u2013 i.e., the front page should inform the potential volunteer of how many volunteer slots are available for all times as set by the admin.\n\nThe absence of this basic functionality results in unnecessary delays and extra effort from everyone involved.\nThe volunteer signs up, the admin\/organizer is notified, the admin\/organizer must then contact the volunteer to ascertain when they're available, the volunteer must then contact the admin\/organizer to inform them if available\/interested.\nActually, the admin\/organizer would probably need to contact just about ALL the volunteers individually in some cases.  What if a volunteer can only serve at say 3pm for an all-afternoon event.  Another volunteer has claimed 3pm but is flexible and other time slots are empty.  Volunteer #2 is willing to serve at a different time so volunteer #1 can take #2's slot.\nSo on and so forth until agreements can be reached, if at all.\nThis can be a massive waste of time and effort, especially if it ultimately turns out the volunteer(s) can't\/won't serve after all.\n\nAll of that can be remedied with just 2 elements on the sign up page: a \"remaining slots open\" status notice (per time options set by admin) and a \"I'm available at these times\" multi-select dropdown on the sign up page.\nThe plugin would automatically shift time assignments around to eliminate empty slots, all without further effort\/input from any volunteers or the admin.\n\nNo fuss.  No muss.  Boom.  Scheduling resolved in seconds.\n\nThere should also be an option for users to edit\/delete their \"pledge\" (not that they would necessarily bother returning just to cancel; common courtesy is rare these days).\nUsers are assigned the role \"Volunteer\" when they sign up, so integration with member plugins such as Ultimate Member would be perfect.  Or, at least there should be hooks so we can do it with our own functions.\nCreating a separate UM form just for volunteers is easy, but we'd still need to hook into profile edits (we'd need the \"I'm available at these times\" dropdown there as well).\n\n+1 on the suggestion of a calendar format.  Much enhanced aesthetics and functional layout.\n\nAs to complexity, these things add very little to the admin panel and front end pages.  The learning curve remains insignificant. The UX is greatly enhanced and page display remains minimal.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Perfectly Simple<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/calverdigital\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3c57f8d27c2bad688b2f55c912555f98?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3c57f8d27c2bad688b2f55c912555f98?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/calverdigital\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">JobeC <small>(calverdigital)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 19, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">My client has a few volunteer positions each year but only a very small team to recruit and manage them.

Very intuitive, but that's because it's basic. Less is more, perhaps.\n\nMy complaints? \n1) No way to duplicate an opportunity. Seems pretty simple and obvious, and I doubt I'm the first person to have an identical event at the same place at a future time, but with this plugin I have to input everything again. There's not much to enter (less is more, as I said) but it would make my life a tiny bit easier.\n2) Recurring opportunities are essentially useless. I would use recurring opportunities as a stand-in for duplicating one time opportunities, but they can't be displayed together for some reason. Even the docs suggest not using them. Not sure why they exist, TBH.\n3) No way to setup time slots or shifts during an opportunity. At an all day event, I need 2 volunteers for 2 hours each from 9 to 5. All I can do as it currently stands is create 4 separate opportunities (9-11, 11-1, 1-3, 3-5) with 2 volunteer signups for each (unwieldy), or 1 opportunity for the whole day, where people sign up and then I have to ask them what time slot(s) they can work (extra work required).\n\nOn my wish list?\n1) Integration with WP users. I would like logged in users to be able to sign up for an opportunity without having to enter all their information again. If this exists, I don't see it. If it's possible using some other plugin or extension, I haven't found it.\n2) I agree with the idea of showing featured images\/thumbnails on the main Opportunities page. Also seems kind of obvious.\n\nBut hey, I'm a mostly satisfied user!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Practically Perfect<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thegoot24\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/629e874be0976ff02ebae7ccd34f437a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/629e874be0976ff02ebae7ccd34f437a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/thegoot24\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">thegoot24<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 29, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Plugin is very useful and versatile.
