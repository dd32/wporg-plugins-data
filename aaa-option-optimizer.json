Best is to use it normally for a couple of days, or to visit every page on your site and in your admin manually. Then go to the plugin&#8217;s settings screen, and go through the unused options. You can either decide to remove an unused option (they might for instance be for plugins you no longer use), or to set it to not autoload. The latter action is much less destructive: it&#8217;ll still be there, but it just won&#8217;t be autoloaded.<\/p>\n",
