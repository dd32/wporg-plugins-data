Now I can select my dates and the information is there and charted for me.\n\nThe automatic RFM analysis of customers is super useful and identifies the different segments of my customers so that I can customise my marketing to each segment. \n\nPutler does an amazing job of seamlessly consolidating all my data across my Woocommerce store, PayPal and Stripe accounts. \nThe team is constantly working on making Putler better and is always willing to listen to any and all feedback. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Robust Data Analysis + Topnotch Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cholleman\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ccf3b0d56fbf009de8d5b3948c094a44?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ccf3b0d56fbf009de8d5b3948c094a44?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cholleman\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">cholleman<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 17, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Gives you almost everything you need to know about your ecommerce data!
