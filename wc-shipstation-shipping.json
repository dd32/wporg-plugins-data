So, thank you for this! I do plan on upgrading to get the extra features that this app supports, but I will try it out for a few months and just make sure everything runs smooth for a while first.

They have always responded to my emails within 12 hours and have offered excellent support. If there is a feature that doesn\u2019t exist, they are eager to build it. I use the pro plugin because of all the amazing options! My customers can see live rates! I can display different carriers based on country, I can edit each and every detail in shipping zones. I just love how convenient this plugin is. Anyone looking to customize their shipping rates, services and options, look no further! There is no better plugin that can handle it all!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">WORKED PERFECTLY AND TOOK 1 MINUTE TO SET UP<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/limitlessenterprises\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/407c53c1ff6ae13c256c69cc26ab9edf?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/407c53c1ff6ae13c256c69cc26ab9edf?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/limitlessenterprises\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Raoul S <small>(limitlessenterprises)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 3, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are not a lot of plugins this easy to use and set up.
