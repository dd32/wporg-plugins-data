        "description": "<p>PitchPrint is a plugin solution that runs on WordPress + WooCommerce as a Software service providing your clients the ability to create their designs on the fly. It basically provides printing clients an easy to use WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) \u201cDo it yourself\u201d interface for creating artworks for print.<\/p>\n<p>It is an HTML5 based solution that allows you to create templates for products like Business Card, TShirt, Banners, Phone Templates etc.<\/p>\n<p>This solution is fully based on pre-designed templates. Design templates are created in the editor which are then loaded by individual clients based on taste and choice, then modified to fit their needs and requirements. Based on our studies, it is far easier for majority of clients to edit an existing design template than create a whole design artwork from scratch especially for people with little background in graphics. In addition, it significantly reduces the overall time frame a client spends from landing on your site to placing an order.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin allows your site to connect to our servers, loading the app tool for your users to create with. What&#8217;s more.. it&#8217;s Free and you can integrate in minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Please learn more about this service from our site: <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchprint.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PitchPrint.com<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>10.2.2<\/h3>\n<p>Tested up to WordPress 6.3<\/p>\n<h3>10.2.2<\/h3>\n<p>Minor release bug fix<\/p>\n<h3>10.2.1<\/h3>\n<p>Tested up to WordPress 6.3<\/p>\n<h3>10.2.1<\/h3>\n<p>Updated to using adminUrl in non-product pages.<\/p>\n<h3>10.2.0<\/h3>\n<p>Tested up to WordPress 6.3<\/p>\n<h3>10.2.0<\/h3>\n<p>Added compatibility for WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage Upgrade<br \/>\nTested up to WooCommerce 8.0.2<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.9<\/h3>\n<p>Tested up to WordPress 6.3<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.8<\/h3>\n<p>Updates made to project preview in cart.<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.7<\/h3>\n<p>Decoding process improved.<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.6<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed session bug.<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.5<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed session bug.<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.4<\/h3>\n<p>Now using admin-ajax to save and reset project.<\/p>\n<h3>10.1.2<\/h3>\n<p>Added a new workflow<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.28<\/h3>\n<p>Cleared a few warning logs by checking post keys are set.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.27<\/h3>\n<p>Storing customer project against customer id, if project was created as guest, then customer registered when placing order.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.25<\/h3>\n<p>Now attaching order ID to project.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.24<\/h3>\n<p>Tested upto WordPress 6.2 and WooCommerce 7.5.1<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.23<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed glue and pieces implode warning<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.22<\/h3>\n<p>Cart image fix.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.20<\/h3>\n<p>Improved metadata display.<br \/>\nIt is now possible to change the initialization designId via a filter: set_pitchprint_design_id<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.19<\/h3>\n<p>Display pitchprint meta data in cart for newer cart items in later versions of woocommerce.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.18<\/h3>\n<p>Add plugin links<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.17<\/h3>\n<p>Category customization added.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.16<\/h3>\n<p>Minor update &#8211; initiation.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.14<\/h3>\n<p>Improved saveproject &#8211; permissions.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.13<\/h3>\n<p>You can now allow the PitchPrint design preview to act as a product image.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.12<\/h3>\n<p>Made uploaded file names unqiue<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.11<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed an issue with WC 5.6<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.9<\/h3>\n<p>Checking array offset exists on uploadhandler<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.8<\/h3>\n<p>Only showing the duplicate design button on the cart page.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.7<\/h3>\n<p>Tested up to WP 5.7<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.6<\/h3>\n<p>Displaying warning message to switch browser if IE browser is detected.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.5<\/h3>\n<p>Displaying warning message to switch browser if IE browser is detected.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.4<\/h3>\n<p>Minor bug fix relating to session and cookies<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.3<\/h3>\n<p>Minor bug fix relating to cloned projects<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.2<\/h3>\n<p>If cookies are not allowed, we use session.<\/p>\n<h3>10.0.1<\/h3>\n<p>Fixed WC 5.2 compatibility issue.<\/p>\n<h4>10.0.0<\/h4>\n<p>No longer using session to store projects.

All I wanted was to provide my customers with a means of customizing the clothing items they purchased. I came across PitchPrint and I started testing it I must say that I was firstly impressed by the price. Secondly they have plenty of amazing features that will aid me in growing my business, they have a feature which enables my customers to change the color of the clothing items inside the editor. They also have an amazing 3D feature which allows you to view a product from all angles. The editor is simple, easy to use and fully customizable to suite your needs. Last but not least they follow up quite a few times to see whether trial users need any assistance, they offer to set up shop as well. It felt awesome to know that I wasn't just another number but that they had my best interest at heart! Thank you PitchPrint I'll definitely be signing up soon. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Exceptional Web to Print Experience.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hollandsprint\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9aa55eb1fe5d70382d1a79bf97c3e02e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9aa55eb1fe5d70382d1a79bf97c3e02e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hollandsprint\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">hollandsprint<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 17, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">We were looking for a web to print which enabled our users to move and add text and images. Also that they could change fonts and colours of text. We also wanted a system which used modern web standards and integrated with mainstream cart systems - in our case WooCommerce.\n\nPitchprint support have been so great at helping us setup the system. We\u2019re still working through creating more content. Ranking and converting users to sales is still a challenge for us. We\u2019ve learned the barrier to success with any Web to Print system is having enough templates to satisfy a broad range of users. However, the system is so flexible and we can create templates so fast.\n\nIt really is a joy to design in Pitchprint. You can do so much more than you think possible. We are starting to use the system for specific clients jobs. Like a flyer for a real estate agent with their branding already in place. This has been very successful. The client absolutely loves the ease of how they can customise quickly. The PDF\u2019s print beautifully. The subtle option of \u2018bleed without marks\u2019 helps these jobs fly through our imposition workflow without intervention. WE LOVE the output from Pitchprint.\nCreating higher quality templates which we thought was not possible with any Web to print system.\nThere are so many. However a convenience that is easy to overlook, is the ability to group and scale objects together. This makes the experience so much closer to a desktop application. \u2018Ungrouping\u2019 uploaded vector elements such as EPS files is jaw dropping. To re-colour a logo or vector element online is pretty ground breaking. In fact it\u2019s easier to re-colour logo\u2019s in Pitchprint than Illustrator, as illustrator often nest elements in layers and often you are double clicking to find the actual layer to modify the colour.\n\nImage masks are a great way to auto-crop images into interesting shapes. That makes customising a brochure pretty easy.\n\nThe Auto-background remover is an exciting development.\n\nThere are so many amazing mature features within Pitchprint, but there is limited space for the review here. lol.\n\nReading through some of the negative reviews about not getting support, is very surprising, as I have been using it for years, and have found their support is very responsive. I will always get a response. They listen carefully and work through the issue with me. (I had multiple caching plugins happening, which was preventing a user from saving designs. They worked patiently with me until they figured out it was a caching issue on my end)\n\nLovely people to deal with.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Useless<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zihniates\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6f4fed6b1739d34da5f96b143df19ce5?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6f4fed6b1739d34da5f96b143df19ce5?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zihniates\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">zihniates<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 21, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">totally useless. it is a money trap.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not reading<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/simplejimbo\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1f10128fab945698ba583697ab4bbdb6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1f10128fab945698ba583697ab4bbdb6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/simplejimbo\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">sjnotebook.com <small>(simplejimbo)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 8, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Sent an email to request help, the first thing I stated was I already installed woo-commerce, sent them snapshots, and explained in details, after a few days, they replied I needed to install WOO-commerce, again that was the first thing I stated.\nthey are only guessing and not reading the emails.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Best I Have Found!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/printsgicleeshop\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0d398cb1ace8bf161e3a8d55bbdb49c9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0d398cb1ace8bf161e3a8d55bbdb49c9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/printsgicleeshop\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">printsgicleeshop<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 2, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is the best customizer plugin for print shops I have seen!

    "description": "<p>PitchPrint is a plugin solution that runs on WordPress + WooCommerce as a Software service providing your clients the ability to create their designs on the fly. It basically provides printing clients an easy to use WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) \u201cDo it yourself\u201d interface for creating artworks for print.<\/p>\n<p>It is an HTML5 based solution that allows you to create templates for products like Business Card, TShirt, Banners, Phone Templates etc.<\/p>\n<p>This solution is fully based on pre-designed templates. Design templates are created in the editor which are then loaded by individual clients based on taste and choice, then modified to fit their needs and requirements.
