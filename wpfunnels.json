WP funnels came on the scene and I was going to do a client install with cart flows today But instead I decided to go with WP funnels, which I also purchased at a one-time fee. The difference not only in ease of use user experience but also in setup and speed is noticeable. I think that cart flows has rested on its laurels for far too long. and it is starting to get stale. the Gutenberg templates they use in cart flow are even broken out of the box to work with Spectra, which does not leave a good impression.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"> I would say that the real Match up here is going to be between WP funnels and funnel kit. I do believe that funnel kit has the advantage right now with SMS, and if that is important to you then I do believe that funnel kit provides an all-in-one solution. but my goodness the ease of working with WP funnels is something that is really worth considering especially if you do not need SMS Functionality Built into your automation recipes. But who knows maybe WP funnels will start supporting SMS sometime soon and give funnel kit a run for their money. I'm done with anything promoted by cart flows and Adam. sadly he is really good at promoting things and not very good at keeping them current and competitive.
