The search itself doesn't show parameters in the URL so you can never link to custom searches or categories. You can only ever link to the main page list page. The author will state you can use the default wordpress search to find posts but this doesn't allow you to search by the categories and other search settings.<br \/><br \/>Additionally, applications post the title of the job but does not add a link back to the job. This means if you have multiple jobs with the same title, you won't know which one the candidate actually applied for. For me, posting similar jobs with different pay and hours, this makes application management impossible. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excellent support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zaaldesign\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c052f08a2afa329abc3c4d6dc8f4642f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c052f08a2afa329abc3c4d6dc8f4642f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zaaldesign\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">zaaldesign<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 25, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Many thanks to the Themehigh Help Center for their assistance in adjusting the Job Manager &amp; Career plugin to the whishes of my client.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Five star for Customer Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/veenavinu\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/adbc952a4fbdd582d93f14d2c3bc21a7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/adbc952a4fbdd582d93f14d2c3bc21a7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/veenavinu\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">veenavinu<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 8, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Great Support from the team.

It really suits a small business, voluntary group, or personal site where there is not much demand for jobs as you will be the person handling the responses to your own site. If you are in a HR dept. and are going to be dealing with many job applications on a daily basis, you may need something more powerful. But for the average small business, charity, church or voluntary group this is really ideal.\n\nYou have to create two pages. \n(1) Create a 'Page' e.g. called Jobs. Then click to add a shortcode box from the standard WP drop-down menu. \n(2) Go to your Dashboard and open the plugin. Copy and paste a 'shortcode' from the plugin main page back into your Job (standard) page. \n(3) Then create a new job i.e. 'Add New' from the Job Manager menu e.g. 'programmer wanted' \n(4) Publish both your main WP 'Job' page and the actual 'Programmer Wanted' page within the Job Manager menu as well.\n\nIt is important to know that if you do the above you have to publish them both before you see them active in your website.\n\nYou should also make sure you have the 'Job' page included in your main menu, so that it is visible on your site. \n\nVisitors can them click on the 'Job' menu, go to the 'Job' page and contained within that will be a short summary of the job. \n\nWhen they click on that they will be taken to the full job description page created in the plugin. \n\n\n\nHope that helps? If in doubt the support team are very prompt and helpful. I hope they continue to create new plug-ins.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Simple and awesome functionality<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/vismithams\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0cf759118346fe796003f9764b7a2218?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0cf759118346fe796003f9764b7a2218?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/vismithams\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Vivek Narayanankutty Nair <small>(vismithams)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 25, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This plugin is very simple and within few steps we have added our job vacancies.
