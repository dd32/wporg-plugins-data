All centralised\/managed through Vend. \n\nThe fantastic and timely service from Binod has surpassed my expectations, any issues were always fixed, questions answered - always a pleasure to deal with.

Our site has over 2,000 products that we sell in a retail environment, as well as online. If a sale is made in-store, the site's QTY's are updated. If a new product is made in-store, it goes straight on our website. If a product is deleted in store, it gets deleted from our site. You get the picture.\n\nWithout this plugin, we would have had to manage all the stock for the site separately from the stock for the store. We would have had to use up to 5 premium plugins to manage the stock from the site, as well as having a plugin custom made to handle stock forecasting. We would have had to employ an extra staff member to manage the logistics for the site, and we would have constantly had to cross-reference pricing and stock from the retail division. This plugin removed EVERY ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS!!!!!\n\nOne final thing to note is that Sujith and her team of developers have gone above and beyond to offer the most comprehensive support I have ever received from a plugin developer. We required some modifications to be made to the plugin and the team was absolutely fantastic to communicate with and delivered results in a timely manner time and time again. \n\nI can not praise this plugin and it's developers enough. If you need to integrate your Vend products on Wordpress, this is the only plugin I will ever use.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Highly Recommend for Vend Integration!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mckennairwin\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cbd17e5dc55c2ed50b1ffaef84078be2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cbd17e5dc55c2ed50b1ffaef84078be2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mckennairwin\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mckennairwin<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 6, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Love the integration and how Vend talks to Wordpress seamlessly.
