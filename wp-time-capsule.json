        "description": "<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wptimecapsule.com\/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Time Capsule<\/a> was created to ensure peace of mind with WP updates and put the fun back into WordPress. It uses the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect  changes and backs up just the changed files and db entries to your account.<\/p>\n<p>You need to sign up for an account on our website https:\/\/service.wptimecapsule.com to get a 30 days full featured trial.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n<strong>With WP Time Capsule you can<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Backup in real-time<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Staging<\/strong><br \/>\nWith a single click staging it&#8217;s a breeze to test any change you are planning to do on your site. Test your updates on staging with a single click<\/p>\n<p><strong>Auto backup and update<\/strong><br \/>\nWe automatically backup before each update, if an update causes any undesired change. You are a click away from restoring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Encrypted DB backups &amp; GDPR Compatible<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can encrypt your DB backups to add an extra layer of security and makes your backup GDPR compatible. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Clone\/Migrate<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can now use the WPTC backup to clone or migrate your site to a new location at ease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is WP Time Capsule different than other backup plugins?<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\nWPTC is unique in 4 ways &#8211;<br \/>\n1. It backs up and restores only the changed files &amp; DB and not the entire site every time.<br \/>\n2. The files &amp; DB are stored in your cloud storage app &#8211; Amazon S3, Wasabi, Backblaze, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br \/>\n3. We have used the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect changes and maintain file versions. So backups and restores are as reliable as they get.<br \/>\n4. Most importantly, you can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. <\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n1. Sign up an account on our website https:\/\/wptimecapsule.com and you will get a 30 days full featured trial.<br \/>\n2. Install the plugin and login with your wptimecapsule.com account.<br \/>\n3. Next, connect the cloud app where you want to store the backup files. You can use Amazon S3, Wasabi, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br \/>\n4. Once you connect the cloud app, we will automatically begin backing up your complete website to your cloud app account.<\/p>\n<p>After the first full backup is taken, you can schedule a time for WPTC to backup your websites. We will take care of your backups from here on.<br \/>\nThis being done you will officially be <em>disaster-ready<\/em>. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><strong>Backup<\/strong>: Looks for files &amp; DB changes since the last backup and uploads only the changes. The data is then stored securely in your cloud app account.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Restore<\/strong>: Checks revision history and displays the same. You can restore the site to any point in time or restore specific files &amp; DB.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is it better?<\/strong><br \/>\nBACKUP METHOD<br \/>\nTraditionally &#8211; Backups are compressed and zipped. The Bad: Heavy server resource consumption.<br \/>\nWPTC &#8211; No zipping. Changed files are directly dropped into your cloud account. The Good: <strong><em>Uses considerably less server resources<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BACKUP FILE<br \/>\nTraditionally &#8211; Multiple zip files are created every time you backup. The Bad: Precious storage space is wasted.<br \/>\nWPTC &#8211; Backs up incrementally. No multiple copies of files. The Good: <strong><em>Uses far less disk space<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>RESTORE<br \/>\nTraditionally &#8211; Unzip backup and restore the whole site. The Bad: Consumes time and server resource.<br \/>\nWPTC &#8211; Restores only selected files. The Good: <strong><em>Faster restore and you can restore even if you don&#8217;t have access to your site or plugin.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.wptimecapsule.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base<\/a><br \/>\nVisit us at <a href=\"https:\/\/wptimecapsule.com\/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wptimecapsule.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Credits: Michael De Wildt for his WordPress Backup to Dropbox plugin based on which this plugin is being developed.<\/p>\n",

( Preparing for next call from server. ) I deleted and reloaded it all and it \"seems\" to be working. I don't really think it is something I can support long term if it takes this long to upload the first backup. I purchased a account which I will probably getting refunded and I also setup a S3 storage bucket which I don't need now.. seems like this was a HUGE waste of time and I wish the reviews online reflected this situation. It doesn't seem to handle large files so unless you have a VERY SMALL site please try something else<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Very Frustrating<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/2cdesigns\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/18c89efe7dfbd614a210aab3b3be70a6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/18c89efe7dfbd614a210aab3b3be70a6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/2cdesigns\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">2cdesigns<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 1, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">A Long time user of the plugin and I can honestly say if you can get it to work (which I previously had) then it works amazingly\n\nsince I've changed my web hosting providers I've been having an issue with connecting to the WPTC site via wp-admin after many conversations with the support team, basically weren't able to help which again is frustrating.\n\nPreviously I could incrementally backup to google drive without issue but I believe this is where the plugin for one reason or another wants to connect to their system (even though I'm logged in) to their own IP address's WHY? What's the point? if I've authenticated my license....\n\nNow your thinking that this may be a server config error, i can tell you for a fact that every IP they requested i have whitelisted and should be working fine, yet its stuck in the same limbo of unable to bypass the database backup (which is not what i need it for)\n\nreally annoying and deeply frustrating for what actually is a promising backup solution<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing !!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dmsgr\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1da7dc53ee3c4be21c3263896241ccbc?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1da7dc53ee3c4be21c3263896241ccbc?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dmsgr\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">DMSGR<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 8, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Must Have Plugin. \nHighly Recommend, a great tool for developers <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It&#039;s brilliant.

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wptimecapsule.com\/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Time Capsule<\/a> was created to ensure peace of mind with WP updates and put the fun back into WordPress. It uses the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect  changes and backs up just the changed files and db entries to your account.<\/p>\n<p>You need to sign up for an account on our website https:\/\/service.wptimecapsule.com to get a 30 days full featured trial.<\/p>\n<p> <br \/>\n<strong>With WP Time Capsule you can<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Backup in real-time<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Staging<\/strong><br \/>\nWith a single click staging it&#8217;s a breeze to test any change you are planning to do on your site. Test your updates on staging with a single click<\/p>\n<p><strong>Auto backup and update<\/strong><br \/>\nWe automatically backup before each update, if an update causes any undesired change. You are a click away from restoring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Encrypted DB backups &amp; GDPR Compatible<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can encrypt your DB backups to add an extra layer of security and makes your backup GDPR compatible. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Clone\/Migrate<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can now use the WPTC backup to clone or migrate your site to a new location at ease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is WP Time Capsule different than other backup plugins?<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\nWPTC is unique in 4 ways &#8211;<br \/>\n1. It backs up and restores only the changed files &amp; DB and not the entire site every time.<br \/>\n2. The files &amp; DB are stored in your cloud storage app &#8211; Amazon S3, Wasabi, Backblaze, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br \/>\n3. We have used the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect changes and maintain file versions. So backups and restores are as reliable as they get.<br \/>\n4. Most importantly, you can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. <\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n1. Sign up an account on our website https:\/\/wptimecapsule.com and you will get a 30 days full featured trial.<br \/>\n2. Install the plugin and login with your wptimecapsule.com account.<br \/>\n3. Next, connect the cloud app where you want to store the backup files. You can use Amazon S3, Wasabi, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br \/>\n4. Once you connect the cloud app, we will automatically begin backing up your complete website to your cloud app account.<\/p>\n<p>After the first full backup is taken, you can schedule a time for WPTC to backup your websites. We will take care of your backups from here on.<br \/>\nThis being done you will officially be <em>disaster-ready<\/em>. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><strong>Backup<\/strong>: Looks for files &amp; DB changes since the last backup and uploads only the changes. The data is then stored securely in your cloud app account.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>Restore<\/strong>: Checks revision history and displays the same. You can restore the site to any point in time or restore specific files &amp; DB.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is it better?<\/strong><br \/>\nBACKUP METHOD<br \/>\nTraditionally &#8211; Backups are compressed and zipped. The Bad: Heavy server resource consumption.<br \/>\nWPTC &#8211; No zipping. Changed files are directly dropped into your cloud account. The Good: <strong><em>Uses considerably less server resources<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BACKUP FILE<br \/>\nTraditionally &#8211; Multiple zip files are created every time you backup.
