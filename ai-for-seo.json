AI for SEO has got you covered.<br \/>\nWith the &#8220;Fill missing SEO data automatically&#8221; feature, you can sit back as the tool fills out the metadata for you.<br \/>\nAnd yes, this extends to new content too! However, if you&#8217;ve spent time curating specific metadata, rest assured it remains untouched.<\/p>\n<h4>Supported Editors<\/h4>\n<p>The AI for SEO plugin is versatile. It currently supports popular editors like Elementor, BeTheme&#8217;s Muffin-Builder or Be-Builder, and the standard WordPress editor.<br \/>\nAnd we&#8217;re continually expanding this list to encompass more editors.<\/p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Integration<\/h4>\n<p>If you have the Yoast SEO plugin active, the integration is smooth.<br \/>\nWithin the Yoast SEO form, the &#8220;Generate with AI&#8221; button makes it effortless to utilize AI for metadata generation.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s even a &#8220;Generate all SEO&#8221; button for mass application. And for visual learners, the plugin directory houses step-by-step images.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance and Compatibility<\/h4>\n<p>Worried about speed? AI for SEO works in the backend, ensuring your website&#8217;s frontend performance remains unhampered.<br \/>\nHowever, note that multi-site installations are currently unsupported.<\/p>\n<h4>Continuous Improvement<\/h4>\n<p>Our team is constantly working on refining and expanding the plugin&#8217;s capabilities.<br \/>\nWhile some features, like customizing auto-filled SEO data or support for certain editors, are in the pipeline, we&#8217;re always eager to hear from you.
