Includes a feature to send a custom email notification to let your customers know how much time they have to make changes!<\/li>\n<li>Orders processed via the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.woocommerce.com\/document\/woocommerce-rest-api\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce REST API<\/a> means that your site can easily scale to process many repeat orders without stressing your WordPress site or hosting!  No more headaches with the WordPress Cron or Action Schedulers dragging your site performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to view and track checkout orders that originate Autoship and Product Subscriptions as well as orders created (via the WooCommerce REST API) from processing repeat Scheduled Orders.

The following new filters have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_checkout_supported_payment_gateway_save_method_ids&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the <strong>autoship_force_save_card()<\/strong> function in the <em>src\/checkout.php<\/em> file and can be used to filter the id&#8217;s of the save payment method checkout in the checkout form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.8 &#8211; 2022-02-09<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to resolve an error that would occur when a customer would attempt to update a Scheduled Order and no timezone (UTC offset) was selected in the connected QPilot Site.<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to resolve a 400 error that would occur when a customer would attempt to update the Next Occurrence Date on a Scheduled Order after the Processing End Time (defined on the connected QPilot Site) had already passed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.7 &#8211; 2022-01-28<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Display option has been updated to work with the new Date\/Time format used by version 2.2.5+<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.6 &#8211; 2022-01-18<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: the display of customer-facing notifications in the Native UI Display Option has been updated to use the customer-friendly version of the failure messages supplied by the QPilot API for lock window and order processing window validation errors.  This makes it easy for customers to understand that they cannot make changes to a Scheduled Order while it is being processed.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: the checkout page integration has been updated to use the <strong>wp_doing_ajax()<\/strong> function instead of the deprecated <strong>is_ajax()<\/strong> function.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: currency support has been added to the creation of new Scheduled Orders that are created when using the Native UI Display Option by setting the currency associated with the new Scheduled Order to the same currency selected in the WooCommerce Site Settings (found in <em>WP-Admin &gt; WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt;&gt; General (tab)<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Improved: the option labels used in the &#8220;Displaying Scheduled Orders in My Account&#8221; section (found in <em>WP-Admin &gt; Autoship Cloud &gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Options ( tab )<\/em>) to be more descriptive.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: The minimum required version of PHP has been changed from 5.6 to 7.3 in order to help reduce risks of security vulnerabilities possible with older versions of PHP and to support the latest versions of PHP code as recommended by WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: the ability to add a product to the cart with a scheduled frequency using links generated from the Autoship Link Builder. Previously, starting in v2.2.5 products added to the cart using a link generated from the Autoship Link Builder would be added to the cart but only as one-time purchases and not as products scheduled for Autoship.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Fixed: the Embedded App Option customer display header Schedule summary text and action button labels so that they are correctly displayed and visible to the customer.  Previously, starting in v2.2.5, these elements were no longer visible to customers.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed: a Fatal Error that could occur in the <em>My Account &gt; Scheduled Orders<\/em> edit screen when attempting to add a product that has the &#8220;Sold Individually&#8221; flag selected (set in <em>WP-Admin &gt; Products &gt;&gt; Edit Product<\/em>) to an existing Scheduled Order.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Actions! The following new actions have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new &#8216;autoship_customer_user_metrics_refreshed&#8217; action is now available in the autoship_refresh_customer_metrics_for_user() function found in the src\/customers.php file and can be used to fire custom functions after the customer metrics data for a customer has been updated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>= 2.2.5 &#8211; 2021-12-29<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New! This update introduces a change to the Date\/Time format that is used for each Scheduled Order\u2019s Next Occurrence Date.  <strong>After updating the plugin, it is very important to run the additional action to update the Date\/Time format used for existing Scheduled Orders<\/strong>. After updating the plugin, admins will see an Important Notice to complete the upgrade process: <strong>&#8220;Update to Autoship Scheduled Orders Required!&#8221;<\/strong> When the <strong>Upgrade Processing Version<\/strong> button is clicked, existing Scheduled Orders will be updated to work with the new compatible Date\/Time format.<\/li>\n<li>New! Scheduled Orders can now include Time in their Next Occurrence Date.  For example: 2022-01-15 13:15:00<\/li>\n<li>New! A Customer Timezone can now be set for a Scheduled Order! This new setting helps with integrations that want to display the Date for upcoming Scheduled Orders in the timezone that the customer is in.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New! Merchants can now set a Start Time and End Time for Site Processing to control when Scheduled Orders can be automatically processed.  The Autoship Cloud plugin has been updated so that the integration with QPilot will take into account the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time ( set within your connected QPilot Site  <strong><em>Qpilot &gt; Edit Site &gt; Options ( tab )<\/em><\/strong> ).  If a Next Occurrence date-time falls outside the site&#8217;s Processing Start and End Time, it will be automatically adjusted to the Scheduled Order Processing Start time.  The following functionality has been updated to take the Scheduled Order Processing Start and End time into account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the Relative Next Occurrence date and time is calculated when the \u201cSet Next Occurrence Date Relative to Checkout\u201d feature is set a product in the <strong><em>WP-Admin &gt; Edit Product &gt; Autoship ( tab )<\/em><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>How the Next Occurrence date and time is calculated when using the Create Scheduled Order shortcode.<\/li>\n<li>How the Next Occurrence date and time is set when using the Update Schedule functionality in the <strong><em>My Account &gt; Edit Scheduled Order<\/em><\/strong> screen on the native Autoship Scheduled Orders template.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved! The performance of the Edit Scheduled Order(s) screen when using the Native UI display option (viewable by customers in the <em>My Account &gt; Scheduled Orders<\/em> screen) now loads faster by caching the Site Settings options retrieved from the QPilot API.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The integration of the Autoship Cloud plugin with the WooCommerce Cart by updating the <strong>superglobal<\/strong> used from the <strong>$_REQUEST<\/strong> variable to the <strong>$_POST<\/strong> variable to apply the Schedule to the cart items.  This allows developers to customize the <strong>$_POST<\/strong> variable during the Add to Cart call.<\/li>\n<li>Improved: The Offset Processing feature that enables you to process Scheduled Orders days in advance of their Next Occurrence Dates has been improved so that Customers will see that their upcoming Scheduled Order&#8217;s status is \u201cProcessing\u201d during the day(s) ahead of their Next Occurrence Date.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved: The Lock Duration feature has been updated to work with the new Date\/Time format and also improves the customer experience by showing customers that their Scheduled Order is \u201cProcessing\u201d during the time that they are not allowed to make changes. This way your customers see that their Scheduled Order is processing all the way up until their Next Occurrence Date, and are free to make changes only after the Scheduled Order has completed processing.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>New Filters! The following new filters have been added to the plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_site_settings_expiration_duration&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the new autoship_get_remote_site_settings() function found in the <em>src\/admin.php<\/em> file and can be used adjust the expiration duration used for caching the QPilot Site Settings values in the WordPress database.<\/li>\n<li>A new <strong>&#8216;autoship_create_scheduled_order_next_occurrence_offset&#8217;<\/strong> filter has been added to the autoship_get_scheduled_order_data ()  &hellip;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

I can say that confidently. No autoship plugin compares.\n\nLet's just say that we have an incredibly complicated business model, and we're fitting it all into a Woocommerce site. So much of our business is dependent on autoship, and an autoship process that is painless. Beyond that, we had a need for product MAP (first occurrence is one SKU, then we need it to automatically switch to another). Autoship Cloud now does that inherently. The user interface is great, and everything just makes sense.\n\nBut a great plugin can be mediocre if there isn't impeccable support to back it up. I appreciate a well-thought-out, thorough email. Autoship Cloud's support literally has the BEST support email structure. Bulleted, clear, concise, and they respond FAST. If you really need more help, you can have a video call with a member of their team. They're great people, and they work to get you the easiest and cheapest solution.
