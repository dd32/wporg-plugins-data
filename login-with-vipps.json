        "description": "<p>Login with Vipps offers super-easy registration and login from the leading smart-payment app in Norway with more than 3.9 million users. There is no easier login. No more usernames or passwords. Vipps, and your customers are logged in.<\/p>\n<p>The users need only remember their phone number. They are also able to provide information that websites often require, like e-mail, phone numbers and addresses, from their Vipps profile with no tedious data entry.<\/p>\n<p>Logg in with Vipps is fully integrated into WordPress and WooCommerce and is free for both users and webshops. The plugin is easy to modify for your own applications.<\/p>\n<p>This solution is great for all websites that wants to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get more logged-in users<\/li>\n<li>All Vipps-users can create a profile on your website with just one click, and can be logged in directly on the next visit<\/li>\n<li>You can modify content, messaging and retrieve stored shopping carts for the user<\/li>\n<li>Your customers can see order histories and potentially register product returns<\/li>\n<li>More logged-in users gives you better overview and better conversion rates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Free for consumers and webshops<\/h3>\n<p>Login with Vipps is free for both websites and end users.<\/p>\n<h3>Get started<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a user of Vipps for E-Commerce, you can add Login with Vipps to your account on https:\/\/portal.vippsmobilepay.com and find your API-keys there &#8211; see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for more details.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have an account with Vipps, you can order this here: https:\/\/vipps.no\/produkter-og-tjenester\/bedrift\/innlogging-og-identifisering\/logg-inn-med-vipps\/#kom-i-gang . When the order has been processed, you will be notified and you will be able to retrieve the API-keys on https:\/\/portal.vippsmobilepay.com . Then see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for the next steps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress version 4.9 or above<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 7.0 or above<\/li>\n<li>Your website must have an SSL certificate and be available through HTTPS<\/li>\n<li>OpenSSL must be configured for your PHP installation<\/li>\n<li>For WooCommerce, the version requirement is 3.3.4 or above<\/li>\n<li>The port 443 must be open for outward traffic on your servers firewall<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Feature Highlights<\/h3>\n<h4>Fully integrated with WooCommerce<\/h4>\n<p>Allows login and registration on your account pages, cart, checkout and via shortcodes. Addresses automatically synchronized with Vipps on login.<\/p>\n<h4>User can register with one click<\/h4>\n<p>Login with Vipps is the easiest way to create a new account. The user can easily share high-quality data from the user&#8217;s Vipps profile with the site owner. Available information includes name, email, address, phone number, and birth date. The identity of all Vipps users is verified using BankID, Norway&#8217;s leading electronic ID, so rest assured that these are real people with correct name and information. (Please note: Standard WordPress does not register information other than name and email, so apart from WooCommerce, you will need to write code to use this information for your particular application.)<\/p>\n<h4>Link existing account<\/h4>\n<p>Already registered users can link their current accounts when signing in with Vipps or from their account page. Users can choose to update their address information from Vipps.<\/p>\n<h4>Customizable for your application<\/h4>\n<p>You can use the framework of this plugin to implement other solutions that require verified users, without actually requiring login. For example, you might create a system for having users sign their comments with Vipps so as to avoid spam issues.<\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[login-with-vipps text=\"Log in with Vipps\" application=\"wordpress\"]<\/code> &#8211; This will print out a Login with Vipps button that will log you into the given application, which by default can be either WordPress or WooCommerce.<\/li>\n<li><code>[continue-with-vipps text=\"Continue with Vipps\" application=\"wordpress\"]<\/code> &#8211; This is the same, except for a different default text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Customizing the Plugin<\/h3>\n<p>To use &#8216;Continue with Vipps&#8217; in your application, there are two levels of customizations available, except for a mass of filters and hooks.<\/p>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;application&#8217; to log into<\/h4>\n<p>Logging into basic WordPress and into an application like WooCommerce is different in the details, especially with regards to<br \/>\n  * what page to redirect to (the profile page, or your account page, or maybe the checkout page),<br \/>\n  * handling of user data (for WooCommerce you want to update the users&#8217; address)<br \/>\n  * and for error handling.<\/p>\n<p>For your own application, you may well have other actions you want done after new user registration, logins etc. We aim to provide support for as many applications as possible in time, but to create your own, these are the main steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your application with a name. It should be a simple slug, like &#8216;wordpress&#8217; or &#8216;woocommerce&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Create your login button, and make it call the supplied Javascript function &#8220;login_with_vipps&#8221; with your application name as argument.<\/li>\n<li>To customize, you can now modify several filters and hooks, the most important of which would be:<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your application<\/em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes and returns an error-page redirect, the error string, and the login session data as an array. You can here return your own error page.<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_before_<em>your application<\/em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes your logged-in user and a session (which can be called as an array) and is called right before the user is redirected. This would be a good place to add a filter to &#8216;login_redirect&#8217; for instance.<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_users_can_register&#8217;. Takes a truth value, an array of userinfo from Vipps and a session, and should return true only if you allow the user to register<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_create_userdata&#8217;. For newly registered users, takes an array to be passed to wp_update_user, an array of userinfo from Vipps, and a session. You can here add your extra meta fields<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_allow_login&#8217;. Takes a truth value, a user object, userinfo from Vipps and a session, and returns true only if the user is allowed to log in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;action&#8217; apart from logging in<\/h4>\n<p>You may want to do other things than logging in with the users&#8217; confirmed Vipps identity, and this plugin absolutely allows this. This might be submisssions of comments, reviews and so forth without requiring logins, or even just as a convenient way of letting users input their address.<\/p>\n<p>These are the main steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your own action, like &#8216;submitaddress&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Create your button. The handler should call the static method <code>ContinueWithVipps::getAuthRedirect($action)<\/code> (you can also provide an array of sessiondata which will be available in your handlers, and restrict the scope of the data to retrieve from Vipps. The return value is an URL to which you should redirect your user.<\/li>\n<li>Create your error handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your action<\/em>&#8216;. It will receive an error string, a description of the error, sometimes an error hint, and the contents of your session (which will no longer be active). You will need to redirect to your error page here, and show your user the error. The redirect is important, you should not output content in this action.<\/li>\n<li>Create your succes handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your action<\/em>&#8216;. It will receive an array of user information from Vipps, and a live session. This handler too should end with a redirect to your success page. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The rest is a simple matter of programming.<\/p>\n",

If your company has a Vipps number or any other business agreement with Vipps, then this plugin is just brilliant for websites where you want to make life easier for your returning customers. I was so relieved by how easy it was to use, after reading the technical documentation provided by Vipps. Five stars, hands down, and a big Thank You to the developer of this plugin.\n\nIn my case, I have a small webshop run on WooCommerce. I ticked the relevant boxes in the WooCommerce settings to allow customers to register themselves on my website, then installed this plugin. I registered with Vipps. They responded quickly, and I got the necessary API Keys for production environment (i.e. for real life use) in just 2 days. Top tip: ignore all the technical stuff you get when you are welcomed into the test environment by Vipps. Just sit and wait for the production environment API keys. The plugin has done all the hard work for you.\n\nWhen you get an e-mail confirming your API keys for production environment are available, simply copy-paste the relevant details into the fields requested from the plugin, then copy the URL clearly provided in the plugin pages to the relevant field on the Vipps website (see plugin installation guide). That's it! Go to your \"Account\" page (you might need to provide a link on a menu). Above the \"login\" or \"register\" sections, is a nice Vipps banner inviting your customers to log in or register.  \n\nI don't request date of birth when customers normally register (don't need to), and this is not provided by Vipps to my site either. Great!\n\nAbsolutely magical. I'm tech savvy but not a developer.  This plugin is just brilliant. Three copy-paste steps, tick off a couple of checkboxes and customers can immediately register themselves. Just remember to update your GDPR statement. \n\nNo annoying banners with pushy advertising, it's free and it's very smooth. Brilliant, brilliant app that makes life for me and my customers easier.

    "short_description": "Login with Vipps is the easiest way to sign in and create an account. No need to worry about usernames and passwords.",
    "description": "<p>Login with Vipps offers super-easy registration and login from the leading smart-payment app in Norway with more than 3.9 million users. There is no easier login. No more usernames or passwords. Vipps, and your customers are logged in.<\/p>\n<p>The users need only remember their phone number. They are also able to provide information that websites often require, like e-mail, phone numbers and addresses, from their Vipps profile with no tedious data entry.<\/p>\n<p>Logg in with Vipps is fully integrated into WordPress and WooCommerce and is free for both users and webshops. The plugin is easy to modify for your own applications.<\/p>\n<p>This solution is great for all websites that wants to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get more logged-in users<\/li>\n<li>All Vipps-users can create a profile on your website with just one click, and can be logged in directly on the next visit<\/li>\n<li>You can modify content, messaging and retrieve stored shopping carts for the user<\/li>\n<li>Your customers can see order histories and potentially register product returns<\/li>\n<li>More logged-in users gives you better overview and better conversion rates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Free for consumers and webshops<\/h3>\n<p>Login with Vipps is free for both websites and end users.<\/p>\n<h3>Get started<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a user of Vipps for E-Commerce, you can add Login with Vipps to your account on https:\/\/portal.vippsmobilepay.com and find your API-keys there &#8211; see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for more details.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have an account with Vipps, you can order this here: https:\/\/vipps.no\/produkter-og-tjenester\/bedrift\/innlogging-og-identifisering\/logg-inn-med-vipps\/#kom-i-gang . When the order has been processed, you will be notified and you will be able to retrieve the API-keys on https:\/\/portal.vippsmobilepay.com . Then see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for the next steps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Requirements<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress version 4.9 or above<\/li>\n<li>PHP version 7.0 or above<\/li>\n<li>Your website must have an SSL certificate and be available through HTTPS<\/li>\n<li>OpenSSL must be configured for your PHP installation<\/li>\n<li>For WooCommerce, the version requirement is 3.3.4 or above<\/li>\n<li>The port 443 must be open for outward traffic on your servers firewall<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Feature Highlights<\/h3>\n<h4>Fully integrated with WooCommerce<\/h4>\n<p>Allows login and registration on your account pages, cart, checkout and via shortcodes. Addresses automatically synchronized with Vipps on login.<\/p>\n<h4>User can register with one click<\/h4>\n<p>Login with Vipps is the easiest way to create a new account. The user can easily share high-quality data from the user&#8217;s Vipps profile with the site owner. Available information includes name, email, address, phone number, and birth date. The identity of all Vipps users is verified using BankID, Norway&#8217;s leading electronic ID, so rest assured that these are real people with correct name and information. (Please note: Standard WordPress does not register information other than name and email, so apart from WooCommerce, you will need to write code to use this information for your particular application.)<\/p>\n<h4>Link existing account<\/h4>\n<p>Already registered users can link their current accounts when signing in with Vipps or from their account page. Users can choose to update their address information from Vipps.<\/p>\n<h4>Customizable for your application<\/h4>\n<p>You can use the framework of this plugin to implement other solutions that require verified users, without actually requiring login. For example, you might create a system for having users sign their comments with Vipps so as to avoid spam issues.<\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[login-with-vipps text=\"Log in with Vipps\" application=\"wordpress\"]<\/code> &#8211; This will print out a Login with Vipps button that will log you into the given application, which by default can be either WordPress or WooCommerce.<\/li>\n<li><code>[continue-with-vipps text=\"Continue with Vipps\" application=\"wordpress\"]<\/code> &#8211; This is the same, except for a different default text<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Customizing the Plugin<\/h3>\n<p>To use &#8216;Continue with Vipps&#8217; in your application, there are two levels of customizations available, except for a mass of filters and hooks.<\/p>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;application&#8217; to log into<\/h4>\n<p>Logging into basic WordPress and into an application like WooCommerce is different in the details, especially with regards to<br \/>\n  * what page to redirect to (the profile page, or your account page, or maybe the checkout page),<br \/>\n  * handling of user data (for WooCommerce you want to update the users&#8217; address)<br \/>\n  * and for error handling.<\/p>\n<p>For your own application, you may well have other actions you want done after new user registration, logins etc. We aim to provide support for as many applications as possible in time, but to create your own, these are the main steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your application with a name. It should be a simple slug, like &#8216;wordpress&#8217; or &#8216;woocommerce&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Create your login button, and make it call the supplied Javascript function &#8220;login_with_vipps&#8221; with your application name as argument.<\/li>\n<li>To customize, you can now modify several filters and hooks, the most important of which would be:<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your application<\/em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes and returns an error-page redirect, the error string, and the login session data as an array. You can here return your own error page.<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_before_<em>your application<\/em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes your logged-in user and a session (which can be called as an array) and is called right before the user is redirected. This would be a good place to add a filter to &#8216;login_redirect&#8217; for instance.<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_users_can_register&#8217;. Takes a truth value, an array of userinfo from Vipps and a session, and should return true only if you allow the user to register<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_create_userdata&#8217;. For newly registered users, takes an array to be passed to wp_update_user, an array of userinfo from Vipps, and a session. You can here add your extra meta fields<\/li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application<\/em>_allow_login&#8217;. Takes a truth value, a user object, userinfo from Vipps and a session, and returns true only if the user is allowed to log in<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;action&#8217; apart from logging in<\/h4>\n<p>You may want to do other things than logging in with the users&#8217; confirmed Vipps identity, and this plugin absolutely allows this. This might be submisssions of comments, reviews and so forth without requiring logins, or even just as a convenient way of letting users input their address.<\/p>\n<p>These are the main steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your own action, like &#8216;submitaddress&#8217;.<\/li>\n<li>Create your button. The handler should call the static method <code>ContinueWithVipps::getAuthRedirect($action)<\/code> (you can also provide an array of sessiondata which will be available in your handlers, and restrict the scope of the data to retrieve from Vipps. The return value is an URL to which you should redirect your user.<\/li>\n<li>Create your error handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your action<\/em>&#8216;. It will receive an error string, a description of the error, sometimes an error hint, and the contents of your session (which will no longer be active). You will need to redirect to your error page here, and show your user the error. The redirect is important, you should not output content in this action.<\/li>\n<li>Create your succes handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your action<\/em>&#8216;. It will receive an array of user information from Vipps, and a live session. This handler too should end with a redirect to your success page. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The rest is a simple matter of programming.<\/p>\n",
