If enabled, the user will be able to select which unit they wish to store their weight in Metric or Imperial. They will also be able to specify date format and clear all their weight data.<\/li>\n<li>Bar Charts. Fancy something different to a line chart?

As the plugin has grown unexpectedly the code base has became unmaintainable and each upgrade was a pain in the a$$. So, this version fixes that and provides a solid base for the future Pro version. Changes in this release:<\/p>\n<p>New features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better out the box styling and look &#8211; looks sharper and more presentable with no need for CSS knowledge.<\/li>\n<li>Supports UK and US date formats<\/li>\n<li>jQuery UI tabs replaced with cleaner, animated and responsive tabs.<\/li>\n<li>Shortcode name added [weight-loss-tracker] (works in exactly the same way as [weightlosstracker]).<\/li>\n<li>Admin menu has been expanded (ready for Pro version).<\/li>\n<li>Improved form validation and added more visual cues to prompt the user to correct the form.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bug fixes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other shortcodes (like weightloss_weight_difference) return the weight unit but no value when not logged in.

Folder structures have been simplified and tidied.<\/li>\n<li>Increased chart height. Will be configurable in future releases.<\/li>\n<li>Major refactoring of ALL code.<\/li>\n<li>Various PHP performance tweaks to increase load time (e.g. replacing all double quotes for strings and replacing with single).<\/li>\n<li>Added additional CSS class names to HTML elements allowing developers to target their CSS better.<\/li>\n<li>Support added for multiple charts to be placed (the base to build shortcodes \/ widgets in the Pro version).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.20.1<\/h4>\n<p>BUG FIX: Previous release broke the &#8220;Delete all data&#8221; button on admin page.

So to be safe (and save me time), I&#8217;ve changed it to display in pounds only<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.4<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the following tags:<\/p>\n<p>[weightloss_weight_difference] &#8211; total weight lost by the logged in member<br \/>\n[weightloss_weight_start] &#8211; start weight of the logged in member<br \/>\n[weightloss_weight_most_recent] &#8211; end weight of the logged in member<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.2 \/ 1.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Various changes made upon feedback from WordPress submission<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support imperial as well as metric weights<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>1.0<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Build<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

It uses shortcodes so it's extremely easy to use, and man there are plenty of them (over 35).\n\nHere are just a few of my favorite Weight Tracker shortcodes:\n\n- User Custom Fields Awards (displays awards given to user)\n- Calculator (displays BMI, BMR, suggested caloric intake, Macro Nutrients)\n- Chart (displays chart of users weight)\n- Challenges (displays a challenge league table)\n- Notes (displays personalized notes sent to a user from the Admin)\n\nThe Cherry on top is the Support.  Ali is the creator of the plugin and he also provides 5-Star Customer Support.  He is very responsive and knows his creation inside out.\n\nI give Ali and his Weight Tracker Plugin 5-Stars!
