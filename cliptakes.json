Previously, we would send CVs to our clients, we now are able to bring our candidates to life using pre-recorded interviews. Unlike other products we have tried, Cliptakes does not need any on-going input from us, we simply send our candidate a link to their video interview, where they answer our pre-set questions in their own time. Once they have completed their recording they simply click submit and the professionally edited video comes directly to our inbox and can be instantly forwarded on to our clients.\n\nWould definitely recommend.\n\nJoe Birchenall\nDirector <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
