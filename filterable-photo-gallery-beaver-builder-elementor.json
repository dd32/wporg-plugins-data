Visuals are the core element of any website,  they have to be exceptional and appealing at the same time. Xpro Gallery Addon rescues you for this gigantic task. The plugin is developed to cater to any modern gallery display you want. Whether you are an individual, freelancer, or an agency, it takes only a few steps to design a world-class gallery for your or your client\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>Our plugin is a true native Beaver Builder Gallery Plugin that has numerous FREE features for you. It serves as a portal to create fully customizable, responsive, and mobile-friendly galleries <\/p>\n<h4>We Have Been There\u2026<\/h4>\n<p>As an agency owner, we used to face issues while creating custom galleries for our clients. It was a tiresome and time-consuming process that still left us with a lot of complications while understanding the client&#8217;s needs. We tried and tested various plugins available in the WP market but none of them resolved our concerns and some were paid plugins too. So, to break the chains we created <a href=\"https:\/\/beaver.wpxpro.com\/filterable-gallery\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Xpro Gallery for Beaver Builder<\/a>. A truly native addon that harnesses the power of Beaver Builder. It\u2019s Free (most of the features), it is highly responsive, and it takes only a few minutes to create compelling galleries.<\/p>\n<p>You can simply import any templates from our dashboard or create a new one easily and effectively. All you have to do is simply drag-and-drop your images in our pre-defined templates and start creating amazing websites for your clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Gallery for Everyone<\/h3>\n<h4>No Backend. No Learning Curve. No Coding.<\/h4>\n<p>You might have used Gallery Addons &amp; Slider Addons separately. But have you experienced them together? We have integrated both functionalities in Xpro Gallery Addon so you can display your galleries in slider mode too. The best thing? It is extremely easy to use due to our front-end control and live preview features.<\/p>\n<h4>Real-time Preview and Editing<\/h4>\n<p>No other gallery plugin offers this feature. You will see everything in real-time while you create your gallery. We believe everything should be crystal clear to you while designing your website galleries. Keeping this into consideration, we have developed innovative features that will save your time and keep you creative &amp; productive. With our Addon,  you will see real-time design changes, unlike other photo gallery plugins where you have to visit the WordPress dashboard, create a shortcode and then embed it.<\/p>\n<p>We found this a very time-consuming task by going back to the WordPress admin panel to make further changes. We also found that people are looking for easiness to create galleries. So, to solve this problem we decided to create a native photo gallery for beaver builders that deliver an excellent user experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Mobile Toggle with Real-time Preview<\/h4>\n<p>This feature is a huge time saver. Style your filters and menus in real-time for any device display. This gives you a visual presentation of how your photo gallery filters and menu will look on your website that makes you match your designs with the original concept you had in mind.<\/p>\n<h4>Powerful Lightbox<\/h4>\n<p>Xpro is committed to providing modern solutions, and that\u2019s where Lightbox comes into play.
