Will old data be automatically synced?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As soon as you finish setting up our sync, we&#8217;ll only start automatically syncing NEW data. This automatic sync can be enabled\/disabled individually for different data types, like customers, orders, products, inventory and more &#8211; so you can control which new data you&#8217;d like to automatically sync. OLD (historic) data will NOT be automatically synced &#8211; but it&#8217;s easy as pie to push over, using our Push section!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20support%20work%3F'>\nHow does support work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All plans include 24\/7 support ticket assistance with our amazing US\/UK support team! Paid plans include a complimentary 30 minute setup call\/screenshare, and our Scale plan includes 12\/5 phone support.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20sync%20data%20both%20ways%20between%20quickbooks%20online%20into%20woocommerce%3F'>\nCan I sync data both ways between QuickBooks Online into WooCommerce?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Our sync  gives you the ability to automatically sync products &amp; inventory (paid plans only) both directions between WooCommerce and QuickBooks Online  &#8211; automatically and manually (pushing historic data).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20push%20existing%2Fold%20customers%2C%20orders%20%26%20products%20into%20quickbooks%3F'>\nCan I push existing\/old customers, orders &amp; products into QuickBooks?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Heck ya! You can use our Push section to push your existing customers, products, orders and more into QuickBooks &#8211; and even pull products into WooCommerce from QuickBooks! (Our monthly plans have a limit of pushing up to the last 30 days of orders, and the forever free Launch plan has a limit of up to the last 7 days of orders.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20orders%20be%20synced%20as%20soon%20as%20they%27re%20placed%3F'>\nWill orders be synced as soon as they&#8217;re placed?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>They sure will! Why wait all day? Our sync is in real-time \u2013 so new customers, products, orders and more will be automatically synced right away! (Inventory level sync happens every 5 minutes.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20sync%20multiple%20stores%20to%20one%20quickbooks%20online%20account%3F'>\nCan I sync multiple stores to one QuickBooks Online account?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can sync as many WooCommerce stores as you\u2019d like to the same QuickBooks Online account. You will just need a paid plan for each store.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20have%20some%20data%20already%20entered%20into%20quickbooks%2C%20will%20it%20be%20duplicated%3F'>\nIf I have some data already entered into QuickBooks, will it be duplicated?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our sync never duplicates customers, orders or products! If we&#8217;ve already synced an order into QuickBooks, you can update\/push it in WooCommerce, and we&#8217;ll simply update it in QuickBooks. If you have orders in QuickBooks entered manually or by another integration &#8211; that&#8217;s not a problem. Our sync may not recognize them if they don&#8217;t match your WooCommerce order number, but we won&#8217;t attempt to automatically re-sync them.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20more%20faq%20or%20docs%3F'>\nAre there any more FAQ or Docs?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There sure are!

Will I be able to get help if I need it?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost too easy! All you&#8217;ll have to do is connect to QuickBooks and map any existing data together &#8211; that&#8217;s it! We have easy to follow documentation, a setup wizard and even a setup video tutorial &#8211; all to make your setup as seamless as possible! You&#8217;ll always have 24\/7 support ticket access in your account with us, and our sales team has been known to assist with setup questions over our 12\/5 live chat as well \ud83d\ude42 Our paid plans even include a complimentary setup call\/screenshare so we can help answer any questions and make sure you&#8217;re up and running correctly!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20your%20intelligent%20bank%20deposit%20support%20work%2C%20and%20why%20do%20i%20need%20it%3F'>\nHow does your Intelligent Bank Deposit support work, and why do I need it?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Ever get tired of matching all your daily bank deposits from your credit card processor in your QuickBooks Banking feed to the individual daily sales that make up that batch deposit? We are too! That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ll automatically sync new orders in real time to QuickBooks; and at the end of the day, automatically create a Bank Deposit in QuickBooks that intelligently includes all the orders from the day, and calculates any transaction fees (if applicable), so that you&#8217;ll simply \u201cMatch\u201d that to your real-life bank deposit in your Banking feed &#8211; and that&#8217;s it! We have amazing support for Stripe, Authorize.Net, Braintree &#8211; and any card processor that groups daily\/weekly sales into one bank deposit for you!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20quickbooks%20versions%20%2F%20currencies%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhat QuickBooks versions \/ Currencies do you support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Our sync supports all QuickBooks Online versions: Simple Start, Essentials, Plus &amp; Advanced &#8211; in all countries around the world! We also support any currency you have enabled in WooCommerce and QuickBooks &#8211; even multiple currencies!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20should%20my%20products%20be%20as%20i%20start%20getting%20set%20up%20with%20myworks%3F'>\nWhere should my products be as I start getting set up with MyWorks?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: We recommend you at least start with all your products in WooCommerce, and each should have a unique SKU (although not required, it&#8217;s helpful to you going forward). If all of your products are in QuickBooks, that\u2019s fine too \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to pull them into WooCommerce through our sync. Or &#8211; you can start out with a perfectly clean slate, and optionally have us automatically sync new products as you create them.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20compatible%20with%20variations%2C%20groups%2C%20bundled%20products%20%26%20composite%20products%3F'>\nAre you compatible with variations, groups, bundled products &amp; composite products?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: We sure are! Although Bundled &amp; Composite products are not native to WooCommerce (added by a plugin), we still have built-in compatibility with them, so you&#8217;re all covered!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20woocommerce%20extensions%2Fplugins%20you%27re%20already%20compatible%20with%3F'>\nAre there any WooCommerce extensions\/plugins you&#8217;re already compatible with?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: There sure are! We support over 25+ popular WooCommerce extensions &#8211; all included in our paid plans! A few examples of our built-in compatibility are Sequential Order Numbers Pro, Cost of Goods Sold, Avalara, Taxify, WooCommerce Subscriptions and Product Bundles.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
