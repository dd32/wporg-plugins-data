        "description": "<p><a href=\"http:\/\/contextly.com\" title=\"Contextly\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contextly<\/a> is the most powerful and customizable related posts plugin for WordPress.<br \/>\nContextly provides related, popular and evergreen post recommendations to help you build a loyal audience by getting readers to read more of your content and come back to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Contextly&#8217;s smart recommendations can be shown in modules at the end of posts, in the body of stories and in the WordPress sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Contextly is the only related posts plugin that lets readers subscribe by emails to the topics on your site they care about so they can get notified by email when a new post is published &#8211; with no extra work by you.<\/p>\n<p>Our algorithms run on our servers, not yours, so we never slow your site down. You can filter out older posts, non-relevant tags and categories and posts with keywords. You can even choose related links for each story.<\/p>\n<p>We also boost your SEO by making it dead simple to add links in the body of your post to previous stories, and Google crawls our links.<\/p>\n<p>We also send daily, weekly and monthly reports to you that let you and your team know how what&#8217;s doing well on your site and how Contextly is performing.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we don&#8217;t track your users, so we&#8217;re GDPR- and CCPA-compliant.<\/p>\n<p>Contextly comes with a free trial (no credit card required), but operates on a paid subscription basis. You can see our pricing and learn more about what we do on the Contextly website.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple Recommendation Modules \u2013 You can give readers multiple chances to go deeper, via the Main Module at the end of a post; a Siderail that shows up next to posts (what WordPress calls the Sidebar) and mid-story recommendation modules (automatic or curated).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Related Recommendations \u2013 Related content gives your readers an opportunity to dive deeply into a topic and is the most effective strategy to get readers to read more. Our related content is actually related, looking deeply at the content of posts, not just tags and categories. These are computed in our data center, not in your database, so you won\u2019t be slowed down. Top webhosts that ban most relate posts plugins recommend us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Popular Recommendations \u2013 Readers are often interested in your most recent and best content. That is why we make this content available on every page, because every page is the new home page. We use a smart algorithm to identify 10 to 15 popular stories so we keep the popular section varied, no stale top 5 lists here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Evergreen Recommendations \u2013 Good stories should be read well after they have been showcased on the home page. We identify \u201coldies but goodies\u201d and let you choose to resurface them to users. This increases the lifetime value of every story you write.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced Filters \u2013 You can exclude content from recommendations by tag, category or url. You can also set time limits on recommendations, either globally or by individual tags and categories.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Channels Subscriptions \u2013 You can let readers subscribe to be notified by email when new stories are published about the topics they care about. This requires no work on your end and you control what the email notifications look like.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy \u2013 Contextly is GDPR and CCPA-compliant. We don\u2019t share your data with anyone and don\u2019t track your readers.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Wicked-Fast Performance \u2013 Contextly does all the hard work on its servers, so we don\u2019t hit your database like most related post plugins do. We host all our files on a fast, global CDN so images load quickly. That means your site stays fast and if you get a lot of traffic, Contextly won\u2019t bring your site down. That\u2019s also why the top WordPress hosting services ban other plugins and recommend Contextly.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Editorial Control\/Curation \u2013 We believe high-quality content is the result of a happy marriage between humans and smart algorithms. Our curation tools allow writers and editors to control what related posts show up on a story. We then use that info to make better recommendations for the entire site.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsive Designs \u2013 We have multiple designs and image sizes to choose from, and they all look great on mobile and desktops. You can customize their look and feel with a few clicks, while advanced users can customize the CSS.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics \u2013 We send daily, weekly and monthly analytics reports that let you easily see which of your posts are doing well and how engaging they are. You can have these sent to everyone on your team.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Custom Post Types \u2013 If you use custom post types, you can choose which ones to show Contextly recommendations on, and which to keep out.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Video Recommendations \u2013 Our recommendations are not limited to blog posts. We can easily integrate your Youtube channel content. Videos will be displayed where they are most relevant.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>SEO \u2013 The best SEO comes from links in the body of stories linking to previous content. We make it super-easy for writers to add these links without having to leave the post to go search in Google.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal Promotional Links \u2013 If you have a newsletter or an event you\u2019d like to promote, Contextly makes it dead-simple to include that in the recommendation module. That puts promotions where users will actually see them.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About Contextly<\/h3>\n<p>Contextly helps publishers build loyal and return audiences. We do that by creating engagement tools that are good for publications, writers and readers. If you have questions, please write us at info@contextly.com.<\/p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install using the WordPress Gallery for the easiest installation or upload the contextly-related-links folder to your <code>\/wp-content\/plugins\/<\/code> directory.<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>Click on one of our buttons in the Visual Editor or go to Settings- -&gt; Contextly -&gt; Get API Key to get to the set-up wizard. You can then choose your display and get your API key. Save the API key.<\/li>\n<li>Contextly will automatically display related and interesting content suggestions.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20will%20be%20displayed%20if%20i%20don%27t%20choose%20related%20posts%3F'>\nWhat will be displayed if I don&#8217;t choose related posts?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got your back. We&#8217;ll automatically show related, evergreen, popular and personalized stories on all posts.<\/p>\n<p>But, we also value editorial wisdom and control, so we make choosing related posts and adding links in the body of the story as easy as possible.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20contextly%20free%3F'>\nIs Contextly free?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contextly offers a free, no credit-card-required 21-day trial. After the free trial, sites can subscribe to a monthly or annual plan.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20contextly%20charge%3F'>\nWhy does Contextly charge?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contextly is a premium service, using state-of-the-art technology and high-powered servers to provide the best recommendations possible. Unlike many related post plugins, we don&#8217;t sell reader information or show ads. Being supported by our users means we can continue to build the most powerful reader engagement service for WordPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20contextly%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill Contextly slow down my site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Our service works outside of WordPress so we don&#8217;t slow down your database. Many related posts plugins use your database and can crash your site if you get substantial traffic.<\/p>\n<p>We also wait to load the recommendations until the rest of your site loads, using asynchronous JavaScript, so readers start reading immediately. And, if for some unforeseen reasons Contextly temporarily stops working &#8212; say if zombies destroy our servers &#8212; your site will still load quickly.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20contextly%20to%20promote%20my%20event%2C%20email%20list%2C%20product%2C%20etc%3F'>\nHow do I use Contextly to promote my event, email list, product, etc?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to Settings -&gt; Contextly -&gt; Settings -&gt; Big Settings Button. Then look for Promo Links. Give us a title and an url of what you want to promote and we&#8217;ll add it to the section you choose.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%20just%20installed%20contextly%20and%20i%20don%27t%20see%20recommendations.%20where%20are%20they%3F'>\nI just installed Contextly and I don&#8217;t see recommendations. Where are they?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It takes us a bit of time to learn and spider a site. Please give us an hour or two and if you still don&#8217;t see related stories, email us at info@contextly.com<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20the%20way%20the%20content%20recommendations%20are%20displayed%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nCan I modify the way the content recommendations are displayed on my site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Our service makes it possible to make many changes with a simple point-and-click interface. For those who want more control, you can create your own custom CSS stylesheet or make CSS changes in the settings panel.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20be%20able%20to%20see%20how%20well%20contextly%20is%20doing%3F'>\nWill I be able to see how well Contextly is doing?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You will get a daily email with statistics about your traffic and related links. Contextly links will also show up in Google Analytics and other traffic measurement software.<\/p>\n<p>You can also see what&#8217;s happening in Google Analytics. We use Events to track clicks. Go to Content -&gt; Events and look for Contextly Sidebar and Contextly Widget. You can dive deep into this.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20custom%20section%20work%3F'>\nHow does the Custom Section work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You give us an RSS feed of content you want us to show off. This can be  a category on your site you like, an RSS feed from a sister site, and for our Business and Enterprise customers, we can include YouTube\/Video and product feeds.<\/p>\n<p>If you just want to choose some items, copy and paste your main RSS feed into the Custom box. Then go to Promo Links and add links you want us to show off and choose the Custom section. Be creative, but there&#8217;s one limitation: you can&#8217;t sell this spot to advertisers unless you arrange that with us first. That&#8217;s because there are certain safeguards against fraud that need to be in place for online ads. Putting external ads in that section without permission is grounds for termination of service.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"http:\/\/contextly.com\" title=\"Contextly\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contextly<\/a> is the most powerful and customizable related posts plugin for WordPress.<br \/>\nContextly provides related, popular and evergreen post recommendations to help you build a loyal audience by getting readers to read more of your content and come back to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Contextly&#8217;s smart recommendations can be shown in modules at the end of posts, in the body of stories and in the WordPress sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Contextly is the only related posts plugin that lets readers subscribe by emails to the topics on your site they care about so they can get notified by email when a new post is published &#8211; with no extra work by you.<\/p>\n<p>Our algorithms run on our servers, not yours, so we never slow your site down. You can filter out older posts, non-relevant tags and categories and posts with keywords. You can even choose related links for each story.<\/p>\n<p>We also boost your SEO by making it dead simple to add links in the body of your post to previous stories, and Google crawls our links.<\/p>\n<p>We also send daily, weekly and monthly reports to you that let you and your team know how what&#8217;s doing well on your site and how Contextly is performing.<\/p>\n<p>Plus we don&#8217;t track your users, so we&#8217;re GDPR- and CCPA-compliant.<\/p>\n<p>Contextly comes with a free trial (no credit card required), but operates on a paid subscription basis. You can see our pricing and learn more about what we do on the Contextly website.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple Recommendation Modules \u2013 You can give readers multiple chances to go deeper, via the Main Module at the end of a post; a Siderail that shows up next to posts (what WordPress calls the Sidebar) and mid-story recommendation modules (automatic or curated).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Related Recommendations \u2013 Related content gives your readers an opportunity to dive deeply into a topic and is the most effective strategy to get readers to read more. Our related content is actually related, looking deeply at the content of posts, not just tags and categories. These are computed in our data center, not in your database, so you won\u2019t be slowed down. Top webhosts that ban most relate posts plugins recommend us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Popular Recommendations \u2013 Readers are often interested in your most recent and best content. That is why we make this content available on every page, because every page is the new home page. We use a smart algorithm to identify 10 to 15 popular stories so we keep the popular section varied, no stale top 5 lists here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Evergreen Recommendations \u2013 Good stories should be read well after they have been showcased on the home page. We identify \u201coldies but goodies\u201d and let you choose to resurface them to users. This increases the lifetime value of every story you write.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced Filters \u2013 You can exclude content from recommendations by tag, category or url. You can also set time limits on recommendations, either globally or by individual tags and categories.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Channels Subscriptions \u2013 You can let readers subscribe to be notified by email when new stories are published about the topics they care about. This requires no work on your end and you control what the email notifications look like.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy \u2013 Contextly is GDPR and CCPA-compliant. We don\u2019t share your data with anyone and don\u2019t track your readers.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Wicked-Fast Performance \u2013 Contextly does all the hard work on its servers, so we don\u2019t hit your database like most related post plugins do. We host all our files on a fast, global CDN so images load quickly. That means your site stays fast and if you get a lot of traffic, Contextly won\u2019t bring your site down. That\u2019s also why the top WordPress hosting services ban other plugins and recommend Contextly.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Editorial Control\/Curation \u2013 We believe high-quality content is the result of a happy marriage between humans and smart algorithms. Our curation tools allow writers and editors to control what related posts show up on a story. We then use that info to make better recommendations for the entire site.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Responsive Designs \u2013 We have multiple designs and image sizes to choose from, and they all look great on mobile and desktops. You can customize their look and feel with a few clicks, while advanced users can customize the CSS.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics \u2013 We send daily, weekly and monthly analytics reports that let you easily see which of your posts are doing well and how engaging they are. You can have these sent to everyone on your team.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Custom Post Types \u2013 If you use custom post types, you can choose which ones to show Contextly recommendations on, and which to keep out.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Video Recommendations \u2013 Our recommendations are not limited to blog posts. We can easily integrate your Youtube channel content. Videos will be displayed where they are most relevant.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>SEO \u2013 The best SEO comes from links in the body of stories linking to previous content. We make it super-easy for writers to add these links without having to leave the post to go search in Google.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Internal Promotional Links \u2013 If you have a newsletter or an event you\u2019d like to promote, Contextly makes it dead-simple to include that in the recommendation module. That puts promotions where users will actually see them.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>About Contextly<\/h3>\n<p>Contextly helps publishers build loyal and return audiences. We do that by creating engagement tools that are good for publications, writers and readers. If you have questions, please write us at info@contextly.com.<\/p>\n",
