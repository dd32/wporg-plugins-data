No complaints whatsoever. We installed it because it had a \"personal wallet\" option, but since June 13 they removed that option. We don't want to use a third-party to handle our crypto, as it is now the case. So we had to find another plugin alternative (we found one which charges $60 for unlimited transactions in a year). I wish we didn't have to find an alternative, and instead Triple A should have offered an option in which you pay a yearly fee... Hope you guys reconsider it, because you are indeed a good company with lots of potential and by doing this you are losing clients like us. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Why have you not send my bitcoin to my walllet?<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/globalminerstech\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0e068ad871fc4ecf055bd1afd5320a71?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0e068ad871fc4ecf055bd1afd5320a71?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/globalminerstech\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Tim Casidy <small>(globalminerstech)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 21, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Before i change this review, i need you to respond to my emails on why i still haven't received my bitcoin when you have already sent me an email that the payment has been completed, since yesterday i still haven't received my BTC and my customers are already complaining, i tried sending BTC to the wallet you generated for my customers and the BTC hasn't entered my wallet too, which means it is two transaction now, but i received an empty confirmation email, please reply my message asap<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
