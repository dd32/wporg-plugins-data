However, you require a strategy to ensure that your samples reach the target customers and establish loyalty.<br \/>\nHere are a few ways in which eCommerce stores are using sample products:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show a sneak peek to the customers into your broad range of offerings with easily consumable and impressive samples<\/li>\n<li>Launch new and riskier products to a new audience in the market and gauge the reaction of customers by launching free samples<\/li>\n<li>Get easy feedback and product reviews from customers regarding your products by giving them samples<\/li>\n<li>Accurately interpret the wants and needs of customers by tracking which samples are ordered the most<\/li>\n<li>Establish your brand as customer-centric by giving out samples of products that are popular in your store<\/li>\n<li>Conduct sample product giveaways and offers for recurring customers, and upsell the real product in their next order<\/li>\n<li>Create a loyal consumer base by offering free products on a timely basis<\/li>\n<li>Offer samples on bulk orders to ensure the customer comes back again<\/li>\n<li>Encourage customers to place larger orders by offering sample WooCommerce products after the cart exceeds a certain amount<\/li>\n<li>Offer samples for high-end products, and encourage customers to try out the more expensive products in your store<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Product Sampling Campaign<\/h3>\n<h4>A 4-step process to design and launch an effective product sampling campaign for your WooCommerce store<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Set Realistic Goals<\/strong><br \/>\nEstablish realistic goals and objectives for your campaign<\/p>\n<p><strong>Select Your Target Audience<\/strong><br \/>\nSelect a target audience and type of key consumers towards whom you want to direct your campaign marketing<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decide the Right Time for Campaign Launch<\/strong><br \/>\nSet a period for your campaign, i.e., close to festivals, holidays etc.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Provide Post-launch Updates to Customers<\/strong><br \/>\nFollow up on the experience with post-purchase updates after sending out samples<\/p>\n<h3>Increase Customer Loyalty<\/h3>\n<h4>Encourage your customers to become recurring buyers<\/h4>\n<p>Customers directly affect your brand&#8217;s performance and its ability to do well. Therefore, they need to interact with your product before spending money on it.<\/p>\n<p>Several brands miss out on potential customers by not opening up their products.

Customers can try your products at minimum to no cost and choose ones that fit their requirements.<\/p>\n<p>You can offer personalized recommendations to improve consumer confidence and increase the chances of getting recurring, long-term buyers for your WooCommerce store.<\/p>\n<h4>\ud83d\udc49 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LITE AND PRO VERSION<\/h4>\n<p>Check the detailed difference between the Pro and Lite \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/product-sample-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>\ud83d\udc81 Contact Us or Submit Support Ticket<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free plugin:<\/strong> Need Technical Help? &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/free-product-sample\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Click here<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Pro Plugin:<\/strong>  PRE-SALE Questions &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.thedotstore.com\/collection\/470-product-sample-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Help Document<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>EXPLORE OUR OTHER PLUGINS TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR WEBSITE:<\/h3>\n<h3>\ud83d\udc49 Premium WooCommerce Plugins list<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/flat-rate-shipping-plugin-for-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Flat-rate shipping plugins for WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-extra-fees-plugin\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Extra Fees Plugin<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-advanced-product-size-charts\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Advanced Product Size Charts For WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/hide-shipping-method-for-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Hide Shipping Method For WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-product-attachment\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Attachment For WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-anti-fraud\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Blocker \u2013 Prevent Fake Orders And Blacklist Fraud Customers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-enhanced-ecommerce-analytics-integration-with-conversion-tracking\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics for WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/product\/woocommerce-category-banner-management\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Category Banner Management for Woocommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-product-finder\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Finder For WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/mass-pages-posts-creator\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Mass Pages Posts Creator For WordPress<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-conditional-discount-rules-for-checkout\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Conditional Discount Rules For WooCommerce Checkout<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/woocommerce-checkout-for-digital-goods\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Checkout For Digital Goods<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedotstore.com\/advance-menu-manager-wordpress\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Advance Menu Manager For WordPress<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>\ud83d\udc49  Some of our other free WooCommerce plugins:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/woo-shipping-display-mode\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Shipping Method Display Style for WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/min-and-max-quantity-for-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Minimum and Maximum Quantity for WooCommerce<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/commenting-feature\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Multicollab \u2013 Google Doc-Style Editorial Commenting for WordPress<br \/>\n<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/multipurpose-block\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Multipurpose Gutenberg Block<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",
