Thus probably most calendars will only give the plain text in the Description in the iCal output.<br \/>\nSecondly: For security reasons  this plugin filters the HTML to convert characters that have special significance in HTML to the corresponding HTML-entities.<\/p>\n<p>But if you trust the output of the calendar application you can set a checkbox to allow safe html in the output. So if you manage to get the HTML in the Description and you set the checkbox to allow safe html you can get that html in the output, with exception of the tags that are not considered safe like SCRIPT and unknown tags.<br \/>\nAnd with the current version  of Google Calendar you can put some HTML in the Description output. (April 2022) I saw the  &lt;a&gt; (link),  &lt;b&gt; (bold text),  &lt;i&gt; (italic text),  &lt;u&gt; (underlined text) and  &lt;br&gt; (linebreak) tags in a iCal description. They will all come through with &#8220;Allow safe html&#8221; checkbox on. Probably even more is possible, but Google can also decide to comply more to the standard.<br \/>\nWith Microsoft Outlook the HTML tags were filtered away and did not reach the iCal description<\/p>\n<p>In case you have all kinds of HTML in your appointments a plugin that uses the API of te calendar-application might be a better choice for you.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20microsoft%20office%20outlook%20calendar%3F'>\nHow to use Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you have to share your calendar to make it public available, or to create and share a public calendar.

With this setting active, at first the widget will be presented as a placeholder with only the title and the text processing. In the HTML of this placeholder are also some ID\\&#8217;s as parameters for the javascript REST call to fetch the content after the page is loaded. This fetch is not executed (correct).<br \/>\nTo work correct Javascript must be enabled in a browser with version newer than 2016 but not in Internet Explorer.<br \/>\nThis is probably caused because the javascript view file with the fetch command is not loaded e.g. in the editor of Elementor or an other pagebuilder that tries to show a preview of the widget but does not load the necessary Javascript. This is a known issue, you could work around it by first set &#8220;Use WordPress timezone settings, no REST&#8221; until you are satisfied with all the other settings and then set &#8220;Use Client timezone &#8230;&#8221;.<br \/>\nIf you change the Sibid without clicking the Update button, the new Sibid may already be saved in the plugin options for the REST call, but not in the block attributes. If you still click Update, the problem will be resolved.<br \/>\nThe REST call might also have failed by other reasons, then another try would probably solve the issue, but I have never seen that in testing.<br \/>\nIf you cannot resolve it, you can of course report an error \/ question in our <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/simple-google-icalendar-widget\" rel=\"ugc\">community support forum<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20an%20event%20calendar%20that%20only%20uses%20days%2C%20not%20times%2C%20like%20a%20holiday%20calendar%3F'>\nCan I use an event calendar that only uses days, not times, like a holiday calendar?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, since v1.2.0, I have tested with <a href=\"https:\/\/p24-calendars.icloud.com\/holiday\/NL_nl.ics\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/p24-calendars.icloud.com\/holiday\/NL_nl.ics<\/a> .<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='this%20block%20has%20encountered%20an%20error%20and%20cannot%20be%20previewed'>\nThis block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably you have (re)opened a page where the block is edited but your password cookie is expired.<br \/>\nLog in in WordPress again and open the page again.

Support WKST.   <\/li>\n<li>2.0.4 Improvements IcsParser made as a result of porting to Joomla<\/li>\n<li>notably solve issue not recognizing http as a valid protocol in array(&#8216;http&#8217;, &#8216;https&#8217;, &#8216;webcal&#8217;) because index = 0 so added 1 as starting index<\/li>\n<li>make timezone-string a property of the object filled with the time-zone setting of the CMS (get_option(&#8216;timezone_string&#8217;)).<\/li>\n<li>replace wp_date() by date() because translation of weekday- and month-names is not needed here.<\/li>\n<li>2.0.3 Added initial values for new attributes in transform.<\/li>\n<li>2.0.2 For block: Added enddate (only when different from startdate) and endtime for first line and summary line, boolean start with summary, selectlist for summary tag,<\/li>\n<li>HTML anchor and improved security by using wp_kess on formatted datetimes. Removed editor style.  <\/li>\n<li>For all: Improved handling of enddate for recurrent events with DATEs (no times) and selection recurrent events also when enddate is after now (was already so with single events)     <\/li>\n<li>2.0.1 Added transform from widget to block. Removed support for anchor because it doesn&#8217;t work and gives error if you don&#8217;t save more then attributes. added example.<\/li>\n<li>2.0.0 Created a native Gutenberg Block Simple ical Block next to the old the widget when using WP 5.9 or higher with the same backend code and almost the same frontend.<\/li>\n<li>1.5.1 After more testing and solving some issues with recurring events and daylight saving time removed the old correction for DST and the temporary checkbox to turn this correction off. Now there is only a correction when time is changed because the calculated time does not exists during transition from ST to DST. In that case in the next recursion the hour and minutes are set back to their beginvalue. Renamed and namespaced classes. Improved Zerodate to UTC-timezone processing. Restructured the IcsParse class a bit.<br \/>\n20220516 tested up to 6.0 (RC2)<\/li>\n<li>1.5.0 in response to a github issue of fhennies added a checkbox to allow safe html in the output. Added wp_kses() function to run for description, digest and location, to echo only html considered safe for wordpress posts, thus preserving some security against XSS.<br \/>\nExtra options for parser in array $instance and added temporary new option notprocessdst to don&#8217;t process differences in DST between start of series events and the current event. (in response to a WP support topic of @wurzelserver)<br \/>\n7-4-2022 tested with wordpress 5.9.1<\/li>\n<li>1.4.1 in response to a support topic of edwindekuiper (@edwindekuiper) fixed timezone error: If timezone appointment is empty or incorrect<br \/>\n    timezone fall back was to new \\DateTimeZone(get_option(&#8216;timezone_string&#8217;)) but with UTC+&#8230; UTC-&#8230; timezonesetting this string is empty<br \/>\n    so I use now wp_timezone() and if even that fails fall back to new \\DateTimeZone(&#8216;UTC&#8217;).<\/li>\n<li>1.4.0 added parameter excerptlength to limit the length in characters of the description in respons to a comment of justmigrating (@justmigrating).<br \/>\n    Fixed a trim error that occurred in a previous version, revising the entire trimming so that both \\r\\n and \\n end of lines are handled properly<br \/>\n    12-7-2021 tested with 5.8-RC2 and set tested up to to 5.8<\/li>\n<li>1.3.1 tested with Outlook and found that different timezones were a problem, solved by using a conversion tabel between Microsoft timezones and Iana timezones and using local (WordPress configuration) timezone when timezone is unknown.<br \/>\nAlso found that colon ended description and summary. Found a solution for that so now you can use a colon in a description or a summary.<br \/>\nTested with iCloud Apple Calendar, timezones seem to be Iana. Issue with url starting with webcal protocol in stead of http or https, work around is substituting webcal with https:, but solved by change in url check and stricter validation Google Id.<\/li>\n<li>1.3.0 made time formats of appointment\/event times configurable in response to a comment of carolynclarkdfw (@carolynclarkdfw) on the plugin page.
