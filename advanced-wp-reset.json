Once a collection is built and saved, you will be able to run all the tools it contains with a single click of the mouse saving you valuable time and hassle.<\/p>\n<p>To take things even further and empower our power users, the Pro version of the plugin has powerful automation and scheduling features that let you choose the time and frequency at which a collection is executed automatically by the system without the need for you to log in and run it manually.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aVJrKj9plpQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>Whether it is a custom Partial Reset Collection, Cleanup Collection, or Optimization Collection\u2026 you\u2019ll be able to automate and schedule its execution with unparalleled ease and control.<\/p>\n<p>When used together, Collections and Scheduling become powerful tools to improve productivity and save time on repetitive yet essential tasks like maintenance or recurring environment resets. We\u2019ve listed a few real-world use cases below for your reference.<\/p>\n<h3>Snapshots and Restoration to the Rescue<\/h3>\n<p>Because Resets perform critical actions on your database and contents with potentially catastrophic consequences on your site, it was imperative to include additional safety mechanisms you could resort to if need be.<\/p>\n<p>Snapshots are a simple yet powerful way of taking full copies of your database to provide you with an invaluable safety net in case things go south. Simply restore your snapshot and you should be good to go.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G3E9LbLa3QI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>In other words, Snapshots create an undo button for Resets as far as database data is concerned. That\u2019s why we highly recommend that you systematically take a snapshot of your site\u2019s database before any Reset.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s always a good idea to take multiple snapshots at different points in time so you can have more than one option if you need to revert to a previous state of your site.<\/p>\n<p>Since snapshots are similar in a way to backups, they can also be used to restore a hacked or damaged database. However, please understand that Snapshots DO NOT replace backups as they don\u2019t save a copy of your files. We thus recommend you use one of the numerous backup tools available.<\/p>\n<p>Even though taking a snapshot is free, quick and easy, our users are sometimes too busy or simply forget to do so. That\u2019s why the plugin comes with a powerful scheduling Pro feature that automates the whole process for you. Just choose the options that best suit your needs and the system will take care of the rest for you.<\/p>\n<h3>WP Switcher for in-depth compatibility Testing (Pro feature)<\/h3>\n<p>Plugin and Theme developers rely on our plugin to speed up their tests and troubleshoot their creations.

Snapshots provide you with a safety net for unexpected situations, ensuring you can easily restore your site to a known state.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='q17%3A%20does%20this%20plugin%20enhance%20my%20website%27s%20security%3F'>\nQ17: Does this plugin enhance my website&#8217;s security?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Advanced WordPress Reset contributes to improved security by allowing you to quickly revert your site to a clean state. If your site experiences security issues or hacks, you can reset it to its default configuration, eliminating potentially compromised files and settings. The tools and collections are also very useful in maintaining a clean website which in turn reduces the risk of successful attacks and hacks.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='q18%3A%20can%20the%20plugin%20safeguard%20my%20data%3F'>\nQ18: Can the plugin safeguard my data?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin offers a reliable way to safeguard your data.

This includes images, videos, music, documents, subfolders, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Reset Themes by deleting all themes (the plugin uses WordPress core functions to delete themes). You can keep the currently active theme or delete it as well<\/li>\n<li>Delete all plugins (the plugin will deactivate them first then uninstall them using WordPress core functions)<\/li>\n<li>Reset \u201cwp-content\u201d folder. All files and folders inside \u2018\/wp-content\u2019 directory will be deleted and reset, except \u2018index.php\u2019 and the following folders: \u2018plugins\u2019, \u2018themes\u2019, \u2018uploads\u2019, and \u2018mu-plugins\u2019<\/li>\n<li>Delete Must-use plugins.

These are plugins that cannot be disabled except by removing their files from the must-use directory<\/li>\n<li>Delete \u201c.htaccess\u201d file. This is a critical WordPress core file used to enable or disable features of websites hosted on Apache. In some cases, you may need to delete it to do some tests<\/li>\n<li>Delete all comments. All types of comments including published, pending, spam, trashed\u2026 will be deleted. Comments meta will also be deleted<\/li>\n<li>Delete pingbacks. Pingbacks allow you to notify other website owners that you have linked to their article on your website<\/li>\n<li>Delete trackbacks. Although there are some minor technical differences, a trackback is the same thing as a pingback<\/li>\n<li>\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The above Tools can also be used to clean up and optimize a WordPress site in order to save disk space, improve performance, or simply reduce security risks by getting rid of unsafe plugins, themes, and files. the possibilities are endless and the only limit is your creativity!<\/p>\n<p>To enable such advanced creative use cases, the Pro version of Advanced WordPress Reset lets you build <strong>Collections<\/strong> of tools where you can pick and choose the tools you want to include in a collection. Once a collection is built and saved, you will be able to run all the tools it contains with a single click of the mouse saving you valuable time and hassle.<\/p>\n<p>To take things even further and empower our power users, the Pro version of the plugin has powerful automation and scheduling features that let you choose the time and frequency at which a collection is executed automatically by the system without the need for you to log in and run it manually.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/aVJrKj9plpQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>Whether it is a custom Partial Reset Collection, Cleanup Collection, or Optimization Collection\u2026 you\u2019ll be able to automate and schedule its execution with unparalleled ease and control.<\/p>\n<p>When used together, Collections and Scheduling become powerful tools to improve productivity and save time on repetitive yet essential tasks like maintenance or recurring environment resets. We\u2019ve listed a few real-world use cases below for your reference.<\/p>\n<h3>Snapshots and Restoration to the Rescue<\/h3>\n<p>Because Resets perform critical actions on your database and contents with potentially catastrophic consequences on your site, it was imperative to include additional safety mechanisms you could resort to if need be.<\/p>\n<p>Snapshots are a simple yet powerful way of taking full copies of your database to provide you with an invaluable safety net in case things go south. Simply restore your snapshot and you should be good to go.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G3E9LbLa3QI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>In other words, Snapshots create an undo button for Resets as far as database data is concerned. That\u2019s why we highly recommend that you systematically take a snapshot of your site\u2019s database before any Reset.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s always a good idea to take multiple snapshots at different points in time so you can have more than one option if you need to revert to a previous state of your site.<\/p>\n<p>Since snapshots are similar in a way to backups, they can also be used to restore a hacked or damaged database. However, please understand that Snapshots DO NOT replace backups as they don\u2019t save a copy of your files. We thus recommend you use one of the numerous backup tools available.<\/p>\n<p>Even though taking a snapshot is free, quick and easy, our users are sometimes too busy or simply forget to do so. That\u2019s why the plugin comes with a powerful scheduling Pro feature that automates the whole process for you. Just choose the options that best suit your needs and the system will take care of the rest for you.<\/p>\n<h3>WP Switcher for in-depth compatibility Testing (Pro feature)<\/h3>\n<p>Plugin and Theme developers rely on our plugin to speed up their tests and troubleshoot their creations. However, such tests are only as good as the version they are run on.<\/p>\n<p>With WP Switcher, a unique feature in Advanced WordPress Reset, we make switching from one WordPress version to another a breeze! Now, you can truly ensure the compatibility of your plugin or theme across different WordPress versions by proactively detecting and addressing any version-specific issues.<\/p>\n<p>WP Switcher offers a convenient one-click feature for changing versions, making it effortless to upgrade or downgrade your existing WordPress version.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UjE6kDUJj5E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p>By utilizing the power of WP Switcher, you can expedite your testing workflow, making sure your projects operate flawlessly across all relevant WordPress versions.<\/p>\n<h3>Advanced WordPress Reset in Real-world Scenarios<\/h3>\n<p>Advanced WordPress Reset is designed to cater to a wide range of users and scenarios.
