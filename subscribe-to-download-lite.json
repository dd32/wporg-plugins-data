I am usually quick to judge with a positive bias because I want to thank the creators as soon as possible. However after actually using and not just testing this plugin, I have discovered some issues.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Number 1 is the plugin limits you to one form only. This was not specified anywhere, at least none that I could see, before I embarked on a journey to download, activate, test out the plugin. I would much rather have limited features and have a simple plugin with paid to upgrade for more features (eg more form fields) than a variety of features but only single use and it would have been good if the creators were upfront about this before I spent all my time testing it out.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Number 2 is that there is no way to delete the form already made. You can edit it, but you can't delete it. This is a little strange.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Bug report: I tried to change the heading and it won't update at all for some reason so I tried to delete the form and start over but there's no option to delete the form. At the moment the form heading says \"This is a heading\" (which is what I put while testing it) but since it can't update, I can't have that in my actual form, so I can't use it. I changed the heading then accessed the form on a totally different device and the form looks the same.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Yes, I have updated the plugin.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">If you are fine with having just one form, which I guess I am fine with, then:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I\u2019d like to leave some information for other users that I figured out.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Regarding the file download link working or not:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Link encryption is available if you want to hide the URL of the file to prevent direct download and to prevent link sharing. However I see that some people say this function leads their users to the homepage rather than the file itself. I did some testing and here is what I found:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><strong>With link encryption on:<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">If the user signs up in a normal (tracked) browser (ie, not private browsing) then clicks on the link in their email inbox in the same type of browser window (even in a different session after you closed the original browser, or in a different device), the link is encrypted and works, the user can download the file (the link leads directly to a download, not a page, so the real url is hidden and shows an encrypted link).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">If the user signs up in a normal (tracked) browser (ie, not private browsing) then opens a&nbsp;<strong>private<\/strong>&nbsp;browsing window to click on the link in their email inbox, and even in a different device, the link is encrypted and still works, the user can download the file (like before, the link leads directly to a download, not a page, so the url is hidden).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><strong>However, the reverse is not true:<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">If the user signs up in a&nbsp;<strong>private<\/strong>&nbsp;browsing session and then tries to click on the link in their email in a&nbsp;<em>normal<\/em>&nbsp;browsing window or a new private browsing session, &lt;span style=\u201dfont-size: inherit;\u201d&gt;ie, if you close the private browsing session by closing all of the private tabs, then try to access the link by opening a new private browsing session, the link no longer works. It will only work in the &lt;\/span&gt;&lt;strong style=\u201dfont-size: inherit;\u201d&gt;same private browsing session&nbsp;<strong>as the one the user signed up in<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\"><strong>WithOUT<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>link encryption<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">For me, the link still leads to a 403 error page which is good if you don\u2019t want the file to be downloadable without signing up, but the URL of the file link is exposed, but given that the file is inaccessible anyway using this method, it doesn\u2019t matter.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">You can also download\/export a CSV file of the subscribers of the form even in the free version.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">There is a field in the free version for names so the plugin is fine the way it is for my purposes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">After the user signs up, the form is blank again so you can sign up again with a different email address, which is great (some plugins simply display a download button once an email address is already entered).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The support is also pretty good. Thank you for this plugin.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Feature suggestion: Tt would be great if the users that subscribe are automatically added to the Wordpress subscriber roles (or any other role of our choosing) so that other plugins that has automated actions (eg send newsletters to a specific group of users or role) can do the same for people from this subscriber's list.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Just what I needed<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joerucci\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/98d39678857579bc0e8194454a8847fa?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/98d39678857579bc0e8194454a8847fa?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joerucci\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">joerucci<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 17, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I needed to send my sample audio files to only subscribed users and this plugin just made it possible.

It is easy enough to set up a download to attract new subscribers, and the pop-ups and static forms look good. However, I have had issues getting this to work consistently. One minute it works great, then the next I get emails from subscribers wondering where their download is (the link takes them to the home page). Not a way to build a subscriber base! I purchased the regular license thinking that customer service would help solve any glitches, but they have been slow to respond and not very helpful. I have deactivated the plugin for now. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
