The support provided by Syncee eas excellent to setup our account, map the appropriate attributes and fields from our WooCommerce shop onto the Syncee platform, filter out products not suitable for dropshipping, establish a catalogue and setup pricing. Ongoing support has been prompt and resolution has been continually satisfactory. They helped us manage our listing whilst the brewery was shutdown and we couldn't fulfil any orders. The system also automatically updates each day, so any changes that I make on our WooCommerce site, that meets the criteria laid out on the Syncee platform, will automatically be updated. 5-stars thus far. \nWhere the platform does not meet our needs, is in the currency. As a supplier, we are forced to deal in only USD. Retailers can choose their currency, and as we are only selling in the UK, our prices are exchanged from GBP into USD. Then back from USD into GBP. Transaction are processed by PayPal, which are in USD, so there is another exchange here. In total, we are looking at about 8-9% of the purchase price in exchange fees. Whilst Syncee doesn't seem to be making anything out of this, there is about 1-1.5% variation on the mid-market rate each time, and then PayPal adds in about 4% FX fees, plus their standard transaction fee.\nAs a result, we've had to keep our prices high, so our retailers aren't making much margin (about 13%), and our profits are approximately \u00a32.5 on a \u00a324.5 sale. Hence, the rating is dropped to 3-star. If USD currency is not an issue for you, then this platform will perform better for you financially.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Easy to connect, but...<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/therab\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/29e207092bea30195c37fd8e02556844?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/29e207092bea30195c37fd8e02556844?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/therab\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">therab<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 30, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The plugin is easy to connect.\nAnd syncee support is very helpful to set up your data and synchronization with syncee. \nDon't try to do it all alone, just ask their support in the chat right in your member area at syncee. They can help you with filters and other settings that you can't change by yourself. \nDespite all efforts of the very helpful support, in the end, we won't use Syncee as long as they don't handle currencies other than US$ - since we need EUR to make it work for us (and our accounting).<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Easy to connect<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/anonymized-20267404\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2d1432786866add6c43a3a38a5152832?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2d1432786866add6c43a3a38a5152832?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/anonymized-20267404\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Anonymous User 20267404 <small>(anonymized_20267404)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 18, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Fast and great support.\nThe plugin is easy to use and can be connected fast to the syncee account.\nAutomatic receiving of orders from the syncee system to the website is a superb function.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great App<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/divinedulcet\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/59a3309acae41cf24dce95487539d29d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/59a3309acae41cf24dce95487539d29d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/divinedulcet\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Katherine Michell Gordillo Quispe <small>(divinedulcet)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 11, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Very good app, in other supplier applications I have to update my products manually and in Syncee it is automatic, as well as the support service is good, they give a quick solution.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
