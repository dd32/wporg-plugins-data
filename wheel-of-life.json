After searching, I found The Wheel of Life, which provided an easy survey UI and graphic display of the results. The Wheel of Life WP plugin is a great assessment tool. I started with the free version to test for my application and quickly upgraded to the Pro version. It's super simple to set up and test. I had a few initial questions that were quickly replied to by Ashish in support. It works great and the graphic display is very cool for users.\n\nI'm absolutely thrilled with the plugin and the support.
