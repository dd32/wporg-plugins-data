I&#8217;ve designed Microthemer for developers as well as beginners. My aim is to level up beginners by exposing the CSS code Microthemer generates when using the visual controls. This is of course helpful for developers who may wish to make manual edits. Some developers use Microthemer as an in-browser CSS or Sass editor, and just lean on the interface for element selection or more advanced properties like filters, grid, and animation.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been happily developing Microthemer and supporting users of varying technical experience in my forum for many years now. I&#8217;m always ready to answer questions about the software and help out with CSS hurdles. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch!<\/p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>7.2.4.9 (November 22nd, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser tab syncing is supported for Gutenberg content changes. This means Microthemer will automatically reload the site preview after making saving a draft or publishing Gutenberg changes. CSS syncing is not supported as yet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs Fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When auto-reloading the site to pull in new content from a synced tab, Microthemer was not always resuming the previous browser scroll position.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.8 (November 1st, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs Fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS added to the full code editor also loaded on the admin area, when it should only load globally on the frontend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.7 (October 19th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs Fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing folder logic could fail if the theme output HTML content prior to starting the PHP output buffer.<\/li>\n<li>Issue with local file system cache displaying outdated inline style tag content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.5 (October 9th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs Fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;TypeError: e.replace is not a function at Object.custom_to_non_escaped&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading &#8217;empty&#8217;)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading &#8216;add&#8217;)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading &#8216;split&#8217;)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading &#8216;interactions&#8217;)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>JS error &#8211; &#8220;TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading &#8216;is&#8217;)&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.4 (September 6th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs Fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Z-index conflict with CartPops plugin meant Microthemer&#8217;s element selection overlays did not display above a shopping cart popup.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.3 (September 5th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New option added to the preferences: &#8220;Auto-focus the code editor cursor after selecting an element&#8221;. This saves time clicking on the code editor after selecting an element, but can also lead to accidental typing in the editor. Furthermore, there may be some bugs as a result of automatically shifting focus &#8211; please report any that you find.<\/li>\n<li>Added a &#8220;Wireframe mode&#8221; option to the Settings &gt; view menu. This gives all elements a semi-transparent gray background and a dashed border. This helps understand the underlying HTML structure of the page, and is useful for identifying elements that cause unwanted overflow on the page, possibly leading to scrollbars appearing in strange places. Microthemer also highlights ::before and ::after pseudo elements &#8211; a bit more faded out, so they&#8217;re distinguishable from regular elements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.2 (September 1st, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Error publishing settings on Cloudways hosting since a recent Cloudways server update. This happened if the &#8220;Minify CSS&#8221; option was enabled in preferences.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.1 (August 3rd, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic error reports only send MT settings for specific errors, even if permission is enabled. I can fix most errors without this additional info, so have switched to a system of explicitly defining errors that should be accompanied by data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS grid highlighting could linger on when switching between selectors in some cases.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.4.0 (July 31st, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible error message could display on the frontend if an empty string was passed into a folder logic condition: Cannot parse $parameterString.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer was not targeting draft pages correctly if the Auto folder option was enabled (because the page slug was not yet set).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.9 (July 26th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer did not notify about user JS errors when working with the full code JS editor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.8 (July 25th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a preview link to the error reporting options, so you can see exactly what data MT will send depending on which checkboxes are ticked.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer sends error reports for unique JavaScript errors it discovers on your site while using Microthemer (edge mode is no longer required).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.7 (July 18th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer does not automatically set the order of selectors within folders when adjusting the selector code, only when selectors are first created (and the Auto folder option is enabled).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleting a design pack did not work if a design pack screenshot had been uploaded.<\/li>\n<li>Syncing the editor and UI did not work on certain properties since the 7.2.3.5 update 6 days ago.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.6 (July 14th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive tabs did not appear to have an effect in certain in browsers, particularly at odd number breakpoints (e.g. 411) or if the browser zoom was set. This is because of pixel rounding issues browsers can encounter. MT fixes this by settings the site preview width slightly above or below the min\/max-width media query values.<\/li>\n<li>When switching between styles docked top (with the options horizontally scrolled) and then docked left, the options could appear cropped.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.5 (July 12th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When adding comma separated box-shadow values to the single selector code editor, MT tried to sync the values with the UI fields, which stripped away all values after the first comma.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.4 (July 11th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer page-specific folder logic did not work if the page slug had the word &#8220;and&#8221; \/ &#8220;or&#8221; in it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.3 (July 11th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS added to the full code editor applied to the WordPress admin area, when viewed inside Microthemer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.3.2 (July 10th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A setup screen displays when you first load Microthemer. This supports importing workspace preferences from another MT install, or setting some commonly changed preferences like global !important or Sass support. You can also set up automatic error reporting and watch the top 10 videos, with progress tracking.<\/li>\n<li>A new condition function is supported e.g. \\Microthemer\\has_template(&#8216;bricks&#8217;, 215, &#8216;Header template&#8217;). Use the conditions menu to generate this kind of logic. It checks if a page loads a particular template, so your custom Microthemer CSS can follow templates around wherever you place them. Right now, only Bricks templates are supported. Feel free to request more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When exporting a design pack, after previously deleting one with the same name, MT presented an error &#8220;Create json error&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>If Auto folder was enabled, setting a custom folder name in the top toolbar during targeting did not work sometimes.<\/li>\n<li>An issue with an exported design pack name being a bit different in the Export screen packs menu.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.8 (June 20th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Issue saving custom folder logic when using a custom port number on localhost e.g. localhost:9017. This may have caused other issues as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.7 (June 19th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer did not create valid conditional folders when targeting content on single post type pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.6 (June 9th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer used to try to maintain the current folder if it loaded on the page, even if that was at odds with the Global vs Page switch in the footer. Now it honours the switch more strictly. This makes the feature more predictable and solves the issue of accidentally switching between global vs page styles when re-selecting elements that have an existing selector.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.5 (June 9th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GZIP compression on the MT interface is enabled by default. This will make MT load faster, and should not occasionally result in a blank page now that the session issue has been addressed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Possible PHP warning about $preferences being defined in Trait and Class.<\/li>\n<li>Possible https warning in the console when saving preferences on the standalone page.<\/li>\n<li>Compatibility issue with GZIP preference if a PHP session was active, a blank screen was displayed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.3 (June 2nd, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When viewing logic settings for a folder with no condition immediately after one that does have a condition, the condition continued to display in the textarea.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.2 (June 1st, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer used to highlight elements in grey if a selector would target the current element, but is in a conditional folder that doesn&#8217;t load on the page. This was useful for hinting if you might want to extend the targeting of an existing selector to other pages, but arguably distracting. As it was necessary to use the &#8220;Create an additional selector&#8221; option fairly frequently. So on balance, I think it&#8217;s better not to highlight such selectors in grey. Grey highlighting is now reserved for when you click a non-loading selector in the folders menu (rather than selecting elements on the page).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer falsely flagged comma separated :not\/:is pseudo selectors as invalid e.g. not:(p, li). Also, MT formatted such comma separated selectors on new lines, which looked messy in the editor.<\/li>\n<li>Possible PHP warning after an initial install when viewing site frontend: Warning: Undefined array key &#8216;initial_scale&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.1 (May 30th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display issue on the view code tabs if a folder name was fairly long.<\/li>\n<li>Custom JavaScript added via the full code view was not loading on the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.2.0 (May 25th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added links to  help videos when displaying the &#8220;Folder not loading&#8221; warning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two issues if &#8220;Stylesheet loading order&#8221; preference was set &#8211; MT could output the same CSS file again under some circumstances (after the body tag). And Microthemer folders did not always show as faded out in the main menu to indicate when they are not loading.<\/li>\n<li>When Microthemer automatically created a folder for the current page, the folder name could be quite long. MT now caps the length at 35 characters, to the nearest whole word.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.9 (May 22nd, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two new conditional loading functions supported:<\/li>\n<li>\\Microthemer\\is_active() &#8211; for checking the currently active theme or plugin.<\/li>\n<li>\\Microthemer\\match_url_path() &#8211; for testing string or regex pattern match on thr current URL path.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Folder logic tests failed to run if the &#8220;Stylesheet loading order&#8221; was set in the preferences.<\/li>\n<li>Issues customizing pages with Microthemer if the page didn&#8217;t run the wp_footer hook.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.8 (May 15th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The previous update caused issues if the &#8216;load stylesheet in footer&#8217; preference was set.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.7 (May 15th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility issue with Divi theme, whereby Divi styles did not load properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.6 (May 14th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of a PHP $_SESSION in the 7.2.1.4 caused issues for some sites. Microthemer now uses $_COOKIE instead.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.5 (May 13th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jumpy layout shift when MT loads for the very first time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.4 (May 12th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asynchronous CSS loads by settings media=&#8221;print&#8221; initially, rather than rel=&#8221;preload&#8221;. Preload isn&#8217;t supported in IE11, and is slightly less performant than switching the media type.<\/li>\n<li>Rolling back to high CSS specificity by default as that may be an adjustment for existing users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New XL2 option added to layout presets. This sets up two columns in left hand sidebar, one for folders another for styles.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draft folders (any folder with only one draft (unsaved) selector in it) were being created twice when navigating between site pages because they were mistakenly assessed as not loading on the new page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.3 (May 11th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer popup screens did not display correctly in yesterday&#8217;s release.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.2 (May 10th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer no longer creates an example selector to target the h1 on the home page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The prev\/next selector arrows did not update correctly when auto-positioning selectors within folders based on the order they appear on the page.<\/li>\n<li>The page-id modifier did not work when set to mtp, on this beta version.<\/li>\n<li>Possible issue loading MT.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.1.0 (May 5th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional folder icons just have an outline, global folders are solid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When adding a condition to a folder, the and\/or buttons could show instead of the &#8220;Add&#8221; button.<\/li>\n<li>Alignment of Auto-folder context menu.<\/li>\n<li>MT was not always highlighting the correct line when showing the source of a Sass compile error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.0.8 (May 4th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The &#8220;Auto Folder&#8221; setting is disabled for users upgrading from previous versions, so that switching to automatic page-specific folders that automatically organise selectors within folders is a deliberate decision.<\/li>\n<li>Slight change to the behaviour when switching between global and page styles &#8211; the folder only changes if you select an initial folder, or you select the next element on the page. This preserves to opportunity to adjust the &#8220;Move current selector&#8221; checkbox.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>JS error when using the &#8220;Detach preview&#8221; feature.<\/li>\n<li>Layout shift when Microthemer was initially loading.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.0.7 (May 1st, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a folder has a condition that effectively makes it global on the frontend or admin area, it is displayed in the Global folders list in the footer.<\/li>\n<li>Global and current page options added to the &#8220;Add condition&#8221; menu.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic page-specific folders did not work correctly when added to the admin area.<\/li>\n<li>Switching to a global folder on the admin side, could default to a frontend only global folder.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.0.6 (April 27th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Change<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The options for leaving Microthemer are only at the bottom right of the interface, they are not in the settings menu anymore.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer&#8217;s default selector labels do not include the parent context, to make them a bit shorter and more readable.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer only minifies PUBLISHED CSS and JS files, and those preferences are enabled by default. Draft CSS files are beautified.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer creates an example selector when you first install it &#8211; Heading 1.<\/li>\n<li>Microthemer generates CSS selectors with low specificity by default. This seems like the best approach when used in combination with the &#8220;Auto folder&#8221; settings, which is enabled by default (see below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microthemer automatically organises your selectors into page-specific folders, with no configuration necessary.<\/li>\n<li>Switch between global and page-specific styles with a single switch in the footer panel.<\/li>\n<li>Or fully disable &#8220;Auto folder&#8221; by unchecking the checkbox in the footer panel.<\/li>\n<li>With &#8220;Auto folder&#8221; enabled, Microthemer adds selectors to folders in an order that matches the HTML DOM order &#8211; the order elements display on the page.<\/li>\n<li>With &#8220;Auto folder&#8221; enabled, Microthemer creates a &#8220;below fold&#8221; variation of any page-specific folder &#8211; if elements are positioned below a height threshold set in Preferences (the default is 1440px).<\/li>\n<li>Added UI support for :is and :where pseudo classes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bugs fixed<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Microthemer shortcut did not display on the frontend.<\/li>\n<li>Possible PHP Warning: Undefined array key &#8220;global_g_fonts&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Adding a selector to a folder manually was not stored in the history table.<\/li>\n<li>Possible file writing error on new installations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>7.2.0.4 (March 16th, 2023)<\/h4>\n<p>Enhancement<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added basic support for container queries.

Selection was exceptionally slow when the Query Monitor Plugin was active, because it adds lots of HTML to the page, but the fix for QM should speed selection up in general, especially for page builders.

And the default value (for new installs only) is &#8216;mtp&#8217; rather than &#8216;mt&#8217;.

the exact CSS classes to modify.\n\nWith Microthemer (Targeting mode turned on) it is very easy to find and change the CSS I need, and I can make simple changes like color, border, position, spacing, sizes etc. and even more advanced stuff like animations within seconds.\n\nI needed to modify the standard WooCommerce checkout page and here Microthemer really shines, it took me no time to modify all the things I needed.\n\nGreat user interface, a lot of features and superb performance. The best part, it is non-destructive because you can easily reset the changes you have made, and all the changes is saved in a separate stylesheet.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Highly recommended<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/martinsauter\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cdb47adc58cd4fd25b578d85efb10198?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cdb47adc58cd4fd25b578d85efb10198?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/martinsauter\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Martin Sauter <small>(martin.sauter)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 31, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I used to write custom CSS code in the theme customizer, which is OK for a few small changes, but not for serious CSS coding.

I'm starting to wonder if the theme developer has shares in that cabal :D...  It's just a beautiful theme though, so have to find a way.\n\nFINALLY with Microthemer it's possible to change the font on the 'blog title' and 'blog description', and all gratitude and respect to the makers.  They have thought of little details that make the workflow much smoother, like the ability to save recommended font families to the top of the drop down list, so you have your limited collection of fonts easily available and don't have to keep scrolling down repeatedly as you swap out the fonts on various elements. It's easy to keep the theme homogeneous looking. \n\nThe documentation is comprehensive and includes 'over and above' topics that aren't part of what the plugin does but will help the user understand the related parameters that will interact with it, such as fonts installation CSS inheritance and many more.\n\nBravo and thank you.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
