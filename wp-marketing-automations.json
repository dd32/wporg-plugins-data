This Plugin, (along with the FunnelKit Funnel Builder) is the HEARTBEAT of my Woocommerce store.

I am not a tech girl by far, but even I can understand these concepts, which is more than I can say for the other email automation I tried and discarded! There's a lot I \"dread\" about this whole building an ecommerce store, but FunnelKit Automations is not one of them!
