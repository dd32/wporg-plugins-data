        "faq": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using the bundled theme for TwentyEleven, -Twelve, or -Thirteen but the Custom CSS and\/or Insert Navigation options have no effect? Or they add a second navigation bar<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is because the navigation for the comics is built into the theme. Using a different theme or overriding the default theme&#8217;s template will allow you to use the options. (however, see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jesgs\/mangapress\/issues\/17\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #17<\/a> for additional issues)<\/p>\n<p><em>Does Manga+Press work on WordPress Multi-site?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes, it does. However, a few steps must be taken to make Manga+Press&#8217; child-themes available to your network. See the question below on the steps to take to enable the child-themes on Multisite.<\/p>\n<p><em>The bundled themes aren&#8217;t available in WordPress Multi-site. What&#8217;s going on?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is because the plugin hasn&#8217;t been activated for the entire MS network. In order for the child-themes to be available, Manga+Press must be available to the entire network. This can be done by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Plugins<\/strong> and clicking the <em>Network Activate<\/em> link for Manga+Press. Once this is done, then both the parent- and child-themes need to made available to the network as well. This can be accomplished by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Themes<\/strong>, selecting the themes in question, choosing <strong>Bulk Actions &gt; Network Enable<\/strong>, and then clicking <strong>Apply<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press responsive?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Not by itself. However, Manga+Press doesn&#8217;t really output markup other than the comic navigation. Responsiveness depends on the theme that is being used. The themes bundled with Manga+Press \u2014 the TwentyEleven thru TwentyFourteen child-themes \u2014 all have some level of responsiveness that is dependent on their parent themes.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with Advanced Custom Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes, it is! Manga+Press is simply a stripped down custom post-type with a custom Featured Image meta-box. Like any other post-type, you can add a new field group using ACF \u2014 however, you <em>will<\/em> have to configure your theme to display these custom fields.<\/p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with the WPML plugin?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I have never had the chance to test Manga+Press with the WPML plugin so I can&#8217;t really guarantee compatibility. Since Manga+Press works like a standard WordPress post, and WPML <em>is<\/em> compatible with custom post-types, this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n<p><em>Do you take feature requests?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I do take feature requests, but I also judge each request on the basis of how well the new feature fits into Manga+Press&#8217; current functionality and also how feasible the new feature is to implement into Manga+Press&#8217; core.<\/p>\n",

I had no problem making it work with my template and I never encountered any weird glitches or errors with my content.\nI do have some minor nitpicks and wishes for future updates if the creator ever decides to continue his work. \n\n1) A \"random comic\" button in the navigation under the comic image would be nice. Perhaps even let us exclude certain categories\/series to give us more control.\n\n2) Better social media compatibility. All SM plugins I used seem to have troubles reading the image for me to share. Reddit seems to work, facebook works occasionally and twitter \/ thumblr don't find the img at all.\n\n3) More control and options for the archive subpage - perhaps let us display and order the categories manually; would be really useful when you have more than 1 category associated with a comic (I'm using css to hide classes to make this work at the moment)\n\n\nIn short; this plugin may lack some features of other more complex ones but it makes up for it for better easy-to-understand usability. A good plugin if your starting out with webcomics and you cant be bothered to invest too much time in programming a complex webcomic site. \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
