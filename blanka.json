Blanka's customer service is EXTRAORDINARY and should be emulated by other PL brands.  Anytime I have an issue during nonbusiness hours, Blanka responds immediately the following day...To be clear our issues are always unrelated to Blanka and usually a result of an internal change. We have never had issues on Blanka's side.. Blanka goes above and beyond whenever we run into technical difficulties on our hosting side, logo changes etc.  We signed up for Blanka about a year before our launch date which resulted in a lot of changes on our end (logo, platform etc) Blanka has remained flexible to our changes, and willing to assist whenever we needed assistance. In regard to the products, Blanka's prices are lower than almost all of the other private labels and also doesn't require high or any MOQs like other companies.  We have been unable to find products more cost effective than Blanka without committing to 10K MOQs or each item. Not only does this allow us to budget towards marketing and other brand costs to help us grow, it also takes the headache of having to plan logistics and distribution to customers. There are only a handful of PLD companies but none have the customer service and brand selection like Blanka. The few competitors they do have charge twice as much out of pocket costs and many have nonexistent customer service.  Blanka has a huge product line and constantly adding more products to the already large selection, the integration between Blanka and selling platform is seamless, and an all around fantastic experience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Smart way to be an entrepreneur<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ritvikminhas28\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2e6ca2d6d7405d3ca4956145992c1a26?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/2e6ca2d6d7405d3ca4956145992c1a26?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ritvikminhas28\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ritvikminhas28<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 15, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Superb customer service, amazing products, easy to navigate user interface.
