Thank you AnyTrack for releasing it!\n\nPartnerize weird tracking links cannot be tracked with other plugins. I mean, if you want to track and attribute your commissions (and not only \"clicks\"), you need to pass custom variables into the Partnerize links. \nNone of hte other redirection plugins could do that, and i could never figure out how to use more advanced linking methods to pass dynamic parameters into the partnerize links.\n\nNow with this plugin, you can do it, out of the box. No code, or any specific configurations required!\n\nThanks again for releasing this plugin!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
