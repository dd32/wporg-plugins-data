It did not show each viewer and what they did specifically. It had very general readings. It would only show the country where your viewers were from. That does not help much if you only do business in the U.S. <br \/>\n  This app shows the specific city or town and exactly which pages each specific visitor visited and how long they stayed on each page specifically.

It did not show each viewer and what they did specifically. It had very general readings. It would only show the country where your viewers were from. That does not help much if you only do business in the U.S. <br \/>\n  This app shows the specific city or town and exactly which pages each specific visitor visited and how long they stayed on each page specifically. I really like this app. Anyone can understand what they are looking at when they open this app.&#8221;<br \/>\n  \u2014 TWIPLA user<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Learn what content resonates in <strong>top Pages<\/strong>.
