It allows you to open any of the templates and you can even make some changes, but when you save it and return to it, your new form will not open. The developer of this plugin is not at all helpful\u2026 initially they told me that the problem could be due to incompatibility with my other plugins or theme, when the documentation for Zigaform (which I read before purchasing) CLEARLY states that there will not be any issues with incompatibility. After pointing that out, the developer then requested ALL of my website and FTP login credentials in order to poke around and TRY to diagnose the problem. Being unwilling to do that because it would compromise the security of my website, I asked about other troubleshooting options and was told there were none. When I asked for a refund, they stopped responding to me. My suggestion to anyone considering this plugin\u2026 DON\u2019T. Keep your money and find something better.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Configuration Issues<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/namelette\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8bdae88133c5fe4a4414e624e188702a?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/8bdae88133c5fe4a4414e624e188702a?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/namelette\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">namelette<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 20, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">\n\nHi I\u2019m having issues figuring out how exactly to set up the confirmation email to customers.\n\nYour site is bare so there is no information there and I don\u2019t want to leave a 1 star until I\u2019ve reached out to you.\n\nIt says:\nCustomer email\nRecipient mail (Choose field to receive notification (field needs to have email validation))\n\nAnd there is nothing to select.
