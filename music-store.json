I want to sell only albums and not individual tracks. All of the information is pulled from the ID3 tag but not used for displaying albums. To sell more than a single track this plugin uses \"collections\" and requires additional work to create. With a large collection, it is just not worth the effort in my opinion. Most of what this plugin does can be done with Woocommerce. I wanted a simple way to display a complete artist list, with their associated albums. It would also be nice to display a list of genres with the associated albums and artists. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Working Great<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/darylwashington\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9eb84fd418b0866487ade115749a0b0b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9eb84fd418b0866487ade115749a0b0b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/darylwashington\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">darylwashington<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 29, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Very nice music store I love it on my site<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">a bit more modifications needed<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/emhikins\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/535aaa2d139486c73aec8fc23342db1b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/535aaa2d139486c73aec8fc23342db1b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/emhikins\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">emhikins<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 6, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It's lacking 2 things \n1. the play function is hard to locate for vistors, it needs to stand out and no site visitor should have to look for it\n\n2. the option of an autoplay for site vistors other than that I would give it a 5 star easily \n\nwell done you guys did a great job<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works great!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dancarroll0608\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/458e96f685c6d2c607177a209968b210?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/458e96f685c6d2c607177a209968b210?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dancarroll0608\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">dancarroll0608<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 15, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I have been very pleased with this plugin.
