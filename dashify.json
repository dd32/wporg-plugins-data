        "changelog": "<h3>1.2.0 (2024-03-27)<\/h3>\n<h4>New features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paginate to the next order of the same status!<\/strong> If an order status is selected in the order list and you click into an order, the order status filter is taken into account when using the next and previous order buttons. It will jump to the next or previous order of the same order status, allowing you to, for example, handle &#8220;Payment pending&#8221; orders one at a time. You can clear this filter at any time from the order view.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Improvements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The order date and time is entirely localized, including aspects like whether it should show AM\/PM or use a 24-hour clock.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Bug fixes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The order time was off by some hours if the WordPress time zone setting was set to anything other than UTC. Now, as long as the viewer of the order date\/time is in the same time zone as the WordPress setting, it will show the correct formatted time for their region.<\/li>\n<li>K\/J shortcuts going past the last\/first order.<\/li>\n<li>A few JavaScript errors about null elements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1.1.3 (2024-03-15)<\/h3>\n<h4>Improvements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Order pagination buttons have tooltips and can be activated via keyboard shortcuts (K for next order, J for previous).<\/li>\n<li>Order pagination is available for non-HPOS WooCommerce.<\/li>\n<li>Order pagination will end at the newest\/oldest order instead of paginating to the same one when on the newest\/oldest order.<\/li>\n<li>Analytics range selection is saved.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Bug fixes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, order pagination could land on a trashed\/deleted order and would show an error page. Now, it will skip these orders.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1.1.2 (2024-03-06)<\/h3>\n<h4>Bug fixes<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If any JS error happened, the page would be blank. Now, it will render the page even if errors are encountered along the way.<\/li>\n<li>Missing bulk actions and Empty Trash button in trash view have been restored.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1.1.1 (2024-03-02)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>No changes from 1.1.0. Re-releasing to try fixing missing download on WordPress.org.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1.1.0 (2024-02-25)<\/h3>\n<h4>New features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Order trend graphs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>1.0.0 (2024-01-21)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First release of Dashify!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
