The EAS Project team bypassed all of those hassles.  <br \/><br \/>Even better, they charge a fee only when VAT-generating sales are made in the EU or UK.  No lump sum or annual recurring costs which can be such a barrier when trying to find a qualified intermediary.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">In addition, their technical team is top notch.  We provided access to our WordPress\/WooCommerce site and they did all the setup remotely.  When we had questions, they were very responsive wtih clear answers. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">And, as icing on the cake, the EAS Project knows how to apply the details of EU and UK VAT regulations, such as charging the lower VAT rates on books that are sold into the EU or UK.  No other plugin that we found implements this level of detail.  We are so glad to be charging the proper, lower rates to our qualifying customers.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Really the best of all the many, many EU and UK VAT options were were pursuing.
