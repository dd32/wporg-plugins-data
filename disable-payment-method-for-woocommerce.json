Suppose the customer order total is $1000 and you have configured plugin to take min $10 as advance payment then customer can place that order by making a $10 payment and remaining payment he can do when the product is delivered to him. this way you can avoid fake cash on delivery orders.<\/p>\n<p>You can restrict what payment option to be available when Partial payment for the order is selected.<\/p>\n<p>you can exclude product from partial payment, there are two way to exclude, first way is by adding a condition so it wont give partial payment option when specific product is in the cart. Second way is to exclude the product such that partial payment option will be given but user will have to pay full amount for those excluded product in the cart and he can pay partial payment for other products.<\/p>\n<h3>PRO version features<\/h3>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited payment disable rule<\/p>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited payment fees<\/p>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited partial payment rules<\/p>\n<p>&#9989; create conditional partial payment rules<\/p>\n<p>&#9989; In multi currency website you can give partial payment option based on the currency selected by the customer<\/p>\n",
