To learn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/demo\/?ref=plugindesc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">request a demo<\/a> with one of our app experts<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>What is MobiLoud?<\/h4>\n<p>MobiLoud is for any WordPress-based business to turn its site into mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p>You can build native apps for a blog or news site, or transform your site directly into iOS and Android apps using MobiLoud Canvas.<\/p>\n<p>MobiLoud is not just a WordPress plugin &#8211; we&#8217;re a complete service. We help you build the apps on our platform. Then we handle testing the apps and submitting them to the App Store and Google Play. It doesn&#8217;t stop there, we provide ongoing maintenance and updates for the lifetime of the apps, saving you thousands of dollars a year in development costs.<\/p>\n<h4>How Does it Work?<\/h4>\n<p>We have two platforms &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/wordpress-news-app\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">News<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/canvas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Canvas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>News<\/strong> for WordPress-based news sites, blogs, magazines, online newspapers, digital publishers and larger media organizations. News lets you build fully featured content apps like those from top publishers like the New York Times or Wall Street Journal. If you&#8217;re a publisher, run a news site or blog built on WordPress, nothing can compete with native mobile apps for boosting loyalty, engagement and revenue on mobile. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Canvas<\/strong> for building hybrid iOS and Android apps from any WordPress site. Canvas lets you build apps with WordPress using your existing theme, all your plugins and site features: everything will work straight out of the box. Canvas is ideal for ecommerces, marketplaces, deals sites, directories, communities, and eLearning sites. It&#8217;s ideal for sites built with BuddyPress, BuddyBoss, Peepso, Learndash and many other platforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What Do They Have in Common?<\/h4>\n<p>Although News and Canvas work differently, they all have some key factors in common.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple, fast<\/strong> &#8212; You&#8217;ll be ready to launch in just weeks, and won&#8217;t need to touch a line of code &#8211; if you don&#8217;t want  to &#8211; while allowing plenty of customization and opportunities to get hands-on with the code for developers and agencies. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Full service<\/strong> &#8212; Our team can handle all the technical tasks necessary to get your app live. You can rely on our experts to completely configure the app for you (read more about our Full Service Package).<\/li>\n<li><strong>No risk guarantee<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud has no long term contracts, and we offer a 60-day guarantee with a full refund if you are not happy with the apps for any reason. We also offer an approval guarantee i.e. if your app is not approved by Apple and Google you can cancel the project and have your money back.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Manage the apps through WordPress<\/strong> &#8212; You can send push notifications and manage the configuration of the apps from a simple dashboard that sits in your WordPress admin dashboard. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Updates and Maintenance included<\/strong> &#8212; Ongoing maintenance of mobile apps costs businesses thousands per year. With MobiLoud it is all handled under our ongoing monthly or annual fees at a fraction of the cost. We&#8217;re there to assist you with any issues you might have with your app or changes you&#8217;d like to make. Stress free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Synced with your site<\/strong> &#8212; You won&#8217;t need to add anything to your workflow, or allocate your team&#8217;s time to managing the apps. They&#8217;ll sync completely with your WordPress site and update with any new content, product or changes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrate (almost) everything from your site<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud lets you leverage the whole ecosystem of WordPress plugins within your apps, and recreate the functionality and features you already built with no limiting templates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Full featured<\/strong> &#8212; All MobiLoud apps come with unlimited push notifications as well as useful features like native sharing, app analytics, advertising integration, message centers, push preferences, and much more. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Native UX<\/strong> &#8212; News produces fully native mobile apps, with a native UX. Although Canvas is for building hybrid apps, the native tab bar and navigation added give the apps a native look and feel. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Which is Right for You?<\/h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the three platforms in a little more detail, so that you can see which is best for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Canvas<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/canvas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Canvas<\/a> is perfect for community sites, startups, social platforms, deals sites, eLearning businesses, and in general any mobile optimized site based on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>Canvas lets you build an app with all the plugins, themes, custom code you used to build your site.<\/p>\n<p>All other WordPress app builders force you into their themes and templates, and don&#8217;t let you fully leverage the flexibility of the WordPress platform like Canvas does.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve published hundreds of apps with Canvas, powered by sites running on LearnDash, BuddyPress, BuddyBoss, PeepSo, and a wide range of other plugins and themes.<\/p>\n<p>Canvas gives you all the key advantages of native mobile apps like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Better Mobile UX<\/strong> &#8212; Your users can just tap once on their home screen and instantly open your app. When inside, the native navigation and tab menu provide a fast and intuitive experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More Loyalty and Engagement<\/strong> &#8212; Apps are great for driving loyalty and engagement. The icon on the home screen and push notifications are a constant reminder of your app &#8211; helping you to boost return visits, dwell time, and LTV. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Push Notifications<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud integrates with OneSignal, allowing you to send unlimited push notifications to iOS and Android devices right from your WordPress back-end. <\/li>\n<li><strong>An App Store Presence<\/strong> &#8212; A brand presence on the App Store and Google Play shows that you are serious about mobile user experience, and makes you look good in the eyes of potential users, partners and investors. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Canvas features<\/h4>\n<p>Canvas is packed with all the features you need to turn your site into great mobile apps. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the key ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Native Tab Menu<\/strong> &#8212; The native tab menu is a key piece of your app. It makes the most important parts instantly accessible and gives a native experience to your users. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Native Navigation<\/strong> &#8212; iOS and Android users will be able to easily navigate through your app with a familiar native interface. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Message Center<\/strong> &#8212; Every push notification that your users receive will be accessed in the app&#8217;s message center so that they can explore them later. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Push Preferences<\/strong> &#8212; Your users can choose which kind of messages they want to receive. This improves their experience and makes your messages more impactful.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Splash Screen<\/strong> &#8212; Your users will see a branded splash screen while your apps load and get visual feedback with a loading indicator. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Configuration Dashboard<\/strong> &#8212; You can control everything about your app from a simple web interface. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fully Customizable<\/strong> &#8212; Make the apps yours with a custom color scheme, logo and splash screen. Control every aspect of your app from our advanced JSON configuration if you know your way around code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Rating Prompts<\/strong> &#8212; Gently nudge your users to review your app after they&#8217;ve used it for some time to help with your app marketing. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Firebase Analytics<\/strong> &#8212; With unlimited reporting and audience segmentation, Firebase will give you everything you need to understand your app users. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Handle External Links<\/strong> &#8212; Your app will be able to handle internal and external links, detecting the link tyle and either opening the device&#8217;s browser or keeping the user in-app<\/li>\n<li><strong>Code Editor<\/strong> &#8212; Inject any custom CSS to change how your pages are displayed in the app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In summary, Canvas is for you if you want apps that mirror your existing WordPress site&#8217;s features and functionality. Anything you can build for the web with WordPress, you can now have an app for too!<\/p>\n<h3>News<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/wordpress-news-app\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">News<\/a> is a custom app building service specifically designed for WordPress based digital publishers.

We publish them to the App Stores, and handle all ongoing updates and maintenance for the lifetime of the apps.<\/p>\n<p>Working with MobiLoud instead of hiring an agency or your own app development team means saving tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of work.

Anything you can build on WordPress you can have in your apps too.<\/p>\n<p>The flexibility doesn&#8217;t stop with integrating themes, plugins, and widgets.<\/p>\n<p>We also give you access to a code editor that allows you to customize and style parts of the app how you see fit and create a truly custom app (or we can do it for you!).<\/p>\n<h4>Customized<\/h4>\n<p>We don&#8217;t just sell you software &#8211; we partner with you to ensure the success of your apps. This starts from the initial planning session, and extends to rigorously testing your apps and preparing them for launch on the App Store and Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re obsessed with the small but important details.<\/p>\n<p>We customize everything from the push notification icons that will pop up on users&#8217; screens, to the native splash screens and App Store icons &#8211; personally taking care of all the details that usually get skipped over or templated.<\/p>\n<h4>A Service, Not Just a Tool<\/h4>\n<p>We take a very proactive approach to customer service.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know our team members by name, and will always be able to count on fast, helpful support.

They can really be there for you in whatever capacity you need them to be for your team&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Adam Griffiths, Product Manager, Foreign Policy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen return visit rates go up since launching the apps \u2013 people will get notifications on their phone and end up going on the site or vice versa. The daily active users are growing nicely and the uninstall rates are really low. Once I&#8217;ve got someone on the app they&#8217;ll stay on the app and keep consuming our content \u2013 which is what we want&#8221;\u009d<br \/>\n<em>Arran Rice, CEO and Founder, Simple Flying<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pietro and his team have found the best solution for a WordPress to mobile app solution. Their plugin is very robust and I was very pleased with the pre-build options that I had control over. I can&#8217;t recommend Mobiloud enough.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Jason Rollison, Pirates Breakdown<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I highly recommend MobiLoud! We had a few additional requirements for our mobile apps that needed the team&#8217;s help. They responded quickly and worked directly with our dev team in order to make all the changes we needed.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Roy Pessis, CTO &amp; Founder, Allmyfaves<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Exceptional service for a great price. Very responsive customer service and truly a one-of-a-kind product.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Chris Burhans, Founder, Sports Mockery<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I had previously worked with four different mobile app developers and none of them were able to get the job done for me the way I wanted it. It took just two days for MobiLoud to get my WordPress website into an iPhone and Android mobile app.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Nick Coffey, The Cardinal Connect<\/em><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/354094380\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/354094639\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/332400724\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/reviews\/?ref=plugindesc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more at MobiLoud.com<\/a><\/p>\n",

While the native format is ideal in the case of news &#8211; for many web apps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/blog\/canvas-is-enough\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Canvas beats native development<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='should%20i%20download%20and%20install%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nShould I download and install this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should download and activate this plugin if you are a MobiLoud customer.

AppPresser is a template based DIY app-builder that creates hybrid apps that pull content from WordPress sites via APIs. You need to use AppPresser&#8217;s own theme and templates for the apps and will be able to use the plugins that they have pre-built integrations for. With AppPresser, it&#8217;s on you to customize your app.<\/p>\n<p>MobiLoud Canvas is different because we let you use all your existing plugins and themes in the apps and don&#8217;t restrict you with templates. Our native platform, News, is used to produce fast, native mobile apps you can customize from a simple dashboard in WordPress or with code.<\/p>\n<p>MobiLoud is also more of a service whereas AppPresser is more of a tool. We don&#8217;t leave you alone to build your apps, we help you build, test and publish them and we maintain them over time.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike AppPresser we offer a 60-day money back guarantee, so you can try our service with no risk!

As long as it works well on mobile, Canvas can make it into an app!<\/p>\n<p>News is for professional WordPress-based digital publishers and high traffic blogs. News isn&#8217;t just an app builder for content sites &#8211; it&#8217;s a complete mobile platform that has been designed specifically to grow revenue, loyalty and engagement. With News you&#8217;ll have apps as good as an international publishing brand, access to premium ad networks to monetize, and features designed to boost audience engagement and retention.

Then after signing up you&#8217;ll configure the app&#8217;s settings through the plugin. Our team will then build the apps, and in a week or so the apps will be ready for you to test on your own devices. When you are happy with the app features and performance, we prepare production binary files and submit and publish your apps on the App Store and Google Play. After a successful launch, we handle all the ongoing updates and maintenance on the apps, saving you thousands per year in developer fees.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20my%20app%20is%20rejected%20by%20apple%3F'>\nWhat if my app is rejected by Apple?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although Apple&#8217;s criteria can seem strict, there is a very low chance that they will reject your apps. We have gone through the process more than 1000 times, and guarantee a successful submission. If they send the apps back for whatever reason, we work with them to make the necessary changes and keep working on it until they are live. In the unlikely event that we can&#8217;t reach a resolution, you&#8217;ll have a full refund.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20know%20any%20coding%20or%20technical%20skills%3F'>\nDo I need to know any coding or technical skills?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You do not need to be a developer to build great apps with our platform, but some familiarity with web technologies is advantageous. You&#8217;ll need to configure some settings and add visual assets in our dashboard, and set up the features you want to use in the apps. As the apps reflect your existing WordPress site though &#8211; you&#8217;ve done all the hard work already. Our team handles the more technical details of the app build for you, including the ongoing maintenance and updates. If you do have web developers on the team, you can use our code editor to style elements of the apps with custom CSS!<\/p>\n<p>Need help with custom development? Get in touch with our team at <a href=\"mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#112;p&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#x40;&#109;&#x6f;&#098;&#105;&#x6c;&#111;u&#x64;&#046;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@mobiloud.com<\/a>, we can help.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20push%20notifications%20work%3F'>\nHow do push notifications work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>MobiLoud integrates with OneSignal, the best push provider on the market. You&#8217;ll be able to send unlimited push notifications right from your WordPress back-end, and configure them to go out automatically for new posts or send them manually whenever you see fit.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use OneSignal&#8217;s excellent documentation, dashboard and APIs to set up advanced push notification configurations &#8211; for example, to create onboarding flows or updating customers when their order status has changed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20time%20and%20effort%20will%20it%20take%20to%20manage%20the%20apps%3F'>\nHow much time and effort will it take to manage the apps?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the great things about MobiLoud apps is that you need to put very little of your time into managing the apps. That&#8217;s because the apps will update automatically with any changes you make on your WordPress site, automatically &#8211; so there&#8217;s nothing to add to your team&#8217;s workflow. If you want to send push notifications or change the configuration of some aspect of the app, you can do so through the plugin and see your app immediately update with the changes.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, mobile apps do need to be maintained regularly. New phones come out, and Apple and Google also release frequent updates to their platforms. Keeping up with this is essential, and costs thousands of dollars per year in developer fees for many businesses. With MobiLoud, you&#8217;re covered. We handle all the necessary updates and maintenance work as part of the ongoing monthly or annual fees you pay.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20build%20mobile%20apps%20with%20mobiloud%3F'>\nHow much does it cost to build mobile apps with MobiLoud?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have different plans depending on the platform you want to use, and the scale of your app project.

The first is to pay for the license that gives you access to our platform, the second is to get our technical support and maintenance service for updates and improvements (new app versions) that make sure your app works as it should on the latest iOS and Android versions, with security updates and other required SDK updates applied as needed. We provide a more engaged, hands on level of service than any other WordPress app builder platform.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20the%20app%27s%20code%3F'>\nCan I modify the app&#8217;s code?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Our code editor allows you to inject custom CSS into the app to style most of its elements. We occasionally offer a source code license to modify the app&#8217;s native platform code, but this is rarely needed for customizations.

Diego and his team told me that they would cancel the apps, but I got hit today for my Apple fees. They really just don't do anything they say they are going to do.

    "description": "<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com?ref=plugindesc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MobiLoud<\/a> lets you turn your WordPress site into quality apps for iOS and Android phones and tablets, published for you to the App Store and Google Play!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Please note that MobiLoud is a premium service, and this plugin is for MobiLoud customers. To learn more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/demo\/?ref=plugindesc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">request a demo<\/a> with one of our app experts<\/em><\/p>\n<h4>What is MobiLoud?<\/h4>\n<p>MobiLoud is for any WordPress-based business to turn its site into mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p>You can build native apps for a blog or news site, or transform your site directly into iOS and Android apps using MobiLoud Canvas.<\/p>\n<p>MobiLoud is not just a WordPress plugin &#8211; we&#8217;re a complete service. We help you build the apps on our platform. Then we handle testing the apps and submitting them to the App Store and Google Play. It doesn&#8217;t stop there, we provide ongoing maintenance and updates for the lifetime of the apps, saving you thousands of dollars a year in development costs.<\/p>\n<h4>How Does it Work?<\/h4>\n<p>We have two platforms &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/wordpress-news-app\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">News<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/canvas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Canvas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>News<\/strong> for WordPress-based news sites, blogs, magazines, online newspapers, digital publishers and larger media organizations. News lets you build fully featured content apps like those from top publishers like the New York Times or Wall Street Journal. If you&#8217;re a publisher, run a news site or blog built on WordPress, nothing can compete with native mobile apps for boosting loyalty, engagement and revenue on mobile. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Canvas<\/strong> for building hybrid iOS and Android apps from any WordPress site. Canvas lets you build apps with WordPress using your existing theme, all your plugins and site features: everything will work straight out of the box. Canvas is ideal for ecommerces, marketplaces, deals sites, directories, communities, and eLearning sites. It&#8217;s ideal for sites built with BuddyPress, BuddyBoss, Peepso, Learndash and many other platforms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>What Do They Have in Common?<\/h4>\n<p>Although News and Canvas work differently, they all have some key factors in common.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple, fast<\/strong> &#8212; You&#8217;ll be ready to launch in just weeks, and won&#8217;t need to touch a line of code &#8211; if you don&#8217;t want  to &#8211; while allowing plenty of customization and opportunities to get hands-on with the code for developers and agencies. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Full service<\/strong> &#8212; Our team can handle all the technical tasks necessary to get your app live. You can rely on our experts to completely configure the app for you (read more about our Full Service Package).<\/li>\n<li><strong>No risk guarantee<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud has no long term contracts, and we offer a 60-day guarantee with a full refund if you are not happy with the apps for any reason. We also offer an approval guarantee i.e. if your app is not approved by Apple and Google you can cancel the project and have your money back.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Manage the apps through WordPress<\/strong> &#8212; You can send push notifications and manage the configuration of the apps from a simple dashboard that sits in your WordPress admin dashboard. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Updates and Maintenance included<\/strong> &#8212; Ongoing maintenance of mobile apps costs businesses thousands per year. With MobiLoud it is all handled under our ongoing monthly or annual fees at a fraction of the cost. We&#8217;re there to assist you with any issues you might have with your app or changes you&#8217;d like to make. Stress free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Synced with your site<\/strong> &#8212; You won&#8217;t need to add anything to your workflow, or allocate your team&#8217;s time to managing the apps. They&#8217;ll sync completely with your WordPress site and update with any new content, product or changes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrate (almost) everything from your site<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud lets you leverage the whole ecosystem of WordPress plugins within your apps, and recreate the functionality and features you already built with no limiting templates.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Full featured<\/strong> &#8212; All MobiLoud apps come with unlimited push notifications as well as useful features like native sharing, app analytics, advertising integration, message centers, push preferences, and much more. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Native UX<\/strong> &#8212; News produces fully native mobile apps, with a native UX. Although Canvas is for building hybrid apps, the native tab bar and navigation added give the apps a native look and feel. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Which is Right for You?<\/h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the three platforms in a little more detail, so that you can see which is best for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Canvas<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/canvas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Canvas<\/a> is perfect for community sites, startups, social platforms, deals sites, eLearning businesses, and in general any mobile optimized site based on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>Canvas lets you build an app with all the plugins, themes, custom code you used to build your site.<\/p>\n<p>All other WordPress app builders force you into their themes and templates, and don&#8217;t let you fully leverage the flexibility of the WordPress platform like Canvas does.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve published hundreds of apps with Canvas, powered by sites running on LearnDash, BuddyPress, BuddyBoss, PeepSo, and a wide range of other plugins and themes.<\/p>\n<p>Canvas gives you all the key advantages of native mobile apps like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A Better Mobile UX<\/strong> &#8212; Your users can just tap once on their home screen and instantly open your app. When inside, the native navigation and tab menu provide a fast and intuitive experience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>More Loyalty and Engagement<\/strong> &#8212; Apps are great for driving loyalty and engagement. The icon on the home screen and push notifications are a constant reminder of your app &#8211; helping you to boost return visits, dwell time, and LTV. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Push Notifications<\/strong> &#8212; MobiLoud integrates with OneSignal, allowing you to send unlimited push notifications to iOS and Android devices right from your WordPress back-end. <\/li>\n<li><strong>An App Store Presence<\/strong> &#8212; A brand presence on the App Store and Google Play shows that you are serious about mobile user experience, and makes you look good in the eyes of potential users, partners and investors. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Canvas features<\/h4>\n<p>Canvas is packed with all the features you need to turn your site into great mobile apps. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the key ones.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Native Tab Menu<\/strong> &#8212; The native tab menu is a key piece of your app. It makes the most important parts instantly accessible and gives a native experience to your users. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Native Navigation<\/strong> &#8212; iOS and Android users will be able to easily navigate through your app with a familiar native interface. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Message Center<\/strong> &#8212; Every push notification that your users receive will be accessed in the app&#8217;s message center so that they can explore them later. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Push Preferences<\/strong> &#8212; Your users can choose which kind of messages they want to receive. This improves their experience and makes your messages more impactful.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Splash Screen<\/strong> &#8212; Your users will see a branded splash screen while your apps load and get visual feedback with a loading indicator. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Configuration Dashboard<\/strong> &#8212; You can control everything about your app from a simple web interface. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Fully Customizable<\/strong> &#8212; Make the apps yours with a custom color scheme, logo and splash screen. Control every aspect of your app from our advanced JSON configuration if you know your way around code.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Rating Prompts<\/strong> &#8212; Gently nudge your users to review your app after they&#8217;ve used it for some time to help with your app marketing. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Firebase Analytics<\/strong> &#8212; With unlimited reporting and audience segmentation, Firebase will give you everything you need to understand your app users. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Handle External Links<\/strong> &#8212; Your app will be able to handle internal and external links, detecting the link tyle and either opening the device&#8217;s browser or keeping the user in-app<\/li>\n<li><strong>Code Editor<\/strong> &#8212; Inject any custom CSS to change how your pages are displayed in the app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In summary, Canvas is for you if you want apps that mirror your existing WordPress site&#8217;s features and functionality. Anything you can build for the web with WordPress, you can now have an app for too!<\/p>\n<h3>News<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/wordpress-news-app\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">News<\/a> is a custom app building service specifically designed for WordPress based digital publishers.

Anything you can build on WordPress you can have in your apps too.<\/p>\n<p>The flexibility doesn&#8217;t stop with integrating themes, plugins, and widgets.<\/p>\n<p>We also give you access to a code editor that allows you to customize and style parts of the app how you see fit and create a truly custom app (or we can do it for you!).<\/p>\n<h4>Customized<\/h4>\n<p>We don&#8217;t just sell you software &#8211; we partner with you to ensure the success of your apps. This starts from the initial planning session, and extends to rigorously testing your apps and preparing them for launch on the App Store and Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re obsessed with the small but important details.<\/p>\n<p>We customize everything from the push notification icons that will pop up on users&#8217; screens, to the native splash screens and App Store icons &#8211; personally taking care of all the details that usually get skipped over or templated.<\/p>\n<h4>A Service, Not Just a Tool<\/h4>\n<p>We take a very proactive approach to customer service.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know our team members by name, and will always be able to count on fast, helpful support. We&#8217;re real people that you can chat with directly via email &#8211; but also on the phone or Zoom whenever necessary.<\/p>\n<p>We solve any issues that crop up directly, you&#8217;ll never be left to fix something yourself or on hold with some unhelpful chatbot.<\/p>\n<h4>No Risk<\/h4>\n<p>We have no long-term contracts, and you can cancel within 60 days and receive a full refund.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t like the apps or decide that you don&#8217;t want to go through with the project within that period &#8211; you get your money back.<\/p>\n<p>Since we oversee both the app build and publishing process we can guarantee that your apps will be approved on the stores.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been through the process 1200+ times, so we know what we&#8217;re doing!<\/p>\n<h4>What some of our customers say about MobiLoud<\/h4>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re set up on WordPress and you&#8217;re serious about WordPress \u2013 MobiLoud really gets WordPress. They can really be there for you in whatever capacity you need them to be for your team&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Adam Griffiths, Product Manager, Foreign Policy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen return visit rates go up since launching the apps \u2013 people will get notifications on their phone and end up going on the site or vice versa. The daily active users are growing nicely and the uninstall rates are really low. Once I&#8217;ve got someone on the app they&#8217;ll stay on the app and keep consuming our content \u2013 which is what we want&#8221;\u009d<br \/>\n<em>Arran Rice, CEO and Founder, Simple Flying<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pietro and his team have found the best solution for a WordPress to mobile app solution. Their plugin is very robust and I was very pleased with the pre-build options that I had control over. I can&#8217;t recommend Mobiloud enough.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Jason Rollison, Pirates Breakdown<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I highly recommend MobiLoud! We had a few additional requirements for our mobile apps that needed the team&#8217;s help. They responded quickly and worked directly with our dev team in order to make all the changes we needed.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Roy Pessis, CTO &amp; Founder, Allmyfaves<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Exceptional service for a great price. Very responsive customer service and truly a one-of-a-kind product.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Chris Burhans, Founder, Sports Mockery<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I had previously worked with four different mobile app developers and none of them were able to get the job done for me the way I wanted it. It took just two days for MobiLoud to get my WordPress website into an iPhone and Android mobile app.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Nick Coffey, The Cardinal Connect<\/em><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/354094380\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/354094639\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/332400724\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobiloud.com\/reviews\/?ref=plugindesc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more at MobiLoud.com<\/a><\/p>\n",
