It's fantastic for what I needed: forms with chat face that I embedded in my sales pages. They are very engaging, and great for conversions.\n\nBut because I needed certain features, like redirect people to a particular web page or no Typeform branding, I needed the Plus tier, which I was bound to renew mid October for 665.50 \u20ac. Same invoice for October 2023, 24, 25...\n\nA friend of mine, to whom I'm very grateful, told me about Tripetto. It was a no brainer, as they say. I have exactly the same features and, with the WP plugin, I pay $99.00 \/year.\n\nI've also found that playing with logic branch is not only easy but also fun. And something else I didn't know before switching, Jurgen has helped me make a seamless transition by pointing me in the right direction when I've needed support. That's 5 stars support too.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Tripetto to any of my competitors, though. ;)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"

You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named &#8216;form faces&#8217; in Tripetto:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autoscroll form face<\/strong>: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform\u2019s conversational forms;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Chat form face<\/strong>: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Classic form face<\/strong>: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. <a href=\"https:\/\/tripetto.com\/form-layouts\/\" title=\"More info about form faces\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See all form layouts.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udca1 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents.
