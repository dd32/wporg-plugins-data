Default Event Tracking Advanced targets two specific types of interactions, and our click tracking targets specific element types (like links, buttons, inputs, etc.) to limit the amount of noise in the data. Continuing to be intentional about the data we collect with our solutions helps mitigate a problem we&#8217;ve called out in the past with these solutions: tracking everything creates a lot of noise in the data.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20impact%20our%20event%20volume%3F'>\nWill this impact our event volume?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. While we&#8217;ve limited click tracking to specific element types, this will count each click the same way as a precisely tracked event. The amount of the increase depends mainly on the organization. Companies just getting started with very few precisely-tracked events would significantly increase their event volume. At the same time, an org with an extensive tracking plan may experience a smaller change. (For example, we saw a 20-30% increase when we implemented it on our site).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20the%20source%20code%20and%20documentation%20for%20the%20scripts%20added%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhere can I find the source code and documentation for the scripts added by the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amplitude Browser SDK (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.docs.developers.amplitude.com\/data\/sdks\/browser-2\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/tree\/main\/packages\/analytics-browser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source code<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/releases?q=analytics-browser&amp;expanded=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">releases<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Advanced Default Event Tracking Plugin (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/tree\/v1.x\/packages\/plugin-default-event-tracking-advanced-browser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source code<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/releases?q=plugin-default-event-tracking-advanced-browser&amp;expanded=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">releases<\/a>) <\/li>\n<li>Session Replay Plugin (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.docs.developers.amplitude.com\/session-replay\/sdks\/plugin\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/tree\/v1.x\/packages\/plugin-session-replay-browser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source code<\/a>) (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/amplitude\/Amplitude-TypeScript\/releases?q=plugin-session-replay-browser&amp;expanded=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">releases<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n\n",
