The paid pro version with its free add-ons is worth the money because it leaves almost nothing to be desired when creating a wide variety of forms. At NEX-Forms, we also appreciate the one-time license fee (in contrast to subscription plans) with lifetime updates and 6-month support by the developer. If you have a problem, you will be presented with a solution quickly (usually within a day). If you need support again after the first 6 months, you have to buy a support extension, but it has a fair price. If possible, the developer also responds to feature requests, which he takes into account in the next updates. We can highly recommend NEX Forms.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This is a SCAM - Has many bugs<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ashrafulsarkar\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09262b102376bea629c7a6d6b3536804?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09262b102376bea629c7a6d6b3536804?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ashrafulsarkar\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Ashraful Sarkar Naiem <small>(ashrafulsarkar)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 5, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Automatic reset plugin setting.

Then, without any warning, the developper change the plugin, so that if you didn't have an activated (paid) license, you would not get any notification anymore when someone submit a form. 1 month after this change I didn't know about, I saw on the plugin page, that 2 people contacted me. I could only see that they contacted me 30 days ago. Could not read what they wrote me and i didn't got any notification. I had to buy the plugin to read their submission. They wanted to buy something very expensive for me. But now it was 30 days too late, I tried to contact them, but they were not interested anymore. So you should really not trust this developper, and actually they are absolutely not GPL. This free version is 100% useless. Create form, but you cant use them, what a joke! <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
