        "description": "<p>The free version of this plugin generates 500 unique raffle ticket numbers and then recycles.  It starts with ticket number 100 and increments each ticket number by 1 until 599.  The 501st ticket will be assigned number 100 again and so on.  This is designed for small raffles.  Upon completing checkout in WooCommerce, the customer is emailed the ticket numbers.<\/p>\n<p>To setup the raffle, simple install the plugin as described below.  Then create a product in WooCommerce and put in the number of raffle tickets for the product.  Example, if you put 5 in the number of tickets field, that product will generate 5 tickets.<\/p>\n<p>Please use https:\/\/wpraffle.com for support.  If you open a support ticket there, you will receive much faster support.  For some reason we are having problems getting alerted to support requests on the repository here at wordpress.org.<\/p>\n<p>Informational videos and FAQs are can be found at https:\/\/wpraffle.com<\/p>\n<p>The Silver and Gold versions of this plugin includes unlimited unique raffle ticket numbers and the number format are fully configurable.  It also allows for a prefix and suffix declaration and can define multiple raffles with different ticket numbers in the same cart.   The Silver Version also included the option to generate graphical ticket images from a selection of stock images and includes a pick a winner feature to select a winner for your raffle and embed it in a page or post using shortcodes.<\/p>\n<p>The Gold version includes Archiving, Backup and Restore capabilities, a 50-50 or Split the Pot Raffle Feature, use custom raffle ticket images, and the ability to manage and limit ticket sales for a specific raffle.  The Gold version also has a successive number feature to put refunded tickets back into stock to be reassigned for events such as a ball drop or duck race.<\/p>\n",

I literally got a response in a few minutes, they resolved my issue right away and guided me through the process. \n\nHonestly, it's been a while since I ran into a company that gives amazing support without having to wait days for a response. I'm sure everyone has been through the same. But not with Raffle Ticket Generator they're on top of their game!!\n\nWish I could give them 10 star rating!! They sure deserve it. And the plugin is easy and works really good for raffles.   <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">No localization options<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/geost\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09bc3f7cd9771069a7975f9c5638327c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/09bc3f7cd9771069a7975f9c5638327c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/geost\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Jorge Calle <small>(Geost)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 28, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The plugin works :) \n\nHowever, I tried translating it with LocoTranslate and it doesn't offer strings for translation.\n\nMore information on how to get this implemented on the plugin here:\n\nhttps:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers\n\nOnce the plugin gets this implemented, I'll be happy to change my rating.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing Plugin, Fantastic Support.

For the guy who says there are no instructions, maybe you should check their site as they have a few step by step videos showing how to set it up.  <\/p>\n<p>Works great for 2 raffles - where one was a 50-50 cash giveaway and one was the grand prize.  A few things would be nice to have if the developer reads this, is to make a choice to be able to show the total amount of a cash raffle and to allow for a percentage.  Example if current tickets are $200 then the prize would be $100.  We will manually go in and post the current value as of xx date, but that would be a nice feature to have.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Attributes...<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/blucable\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d973f46a01c079ce848b70f3e59e77bf?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/d973f46a01c079ce848b70f3e59e77bf?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/blucable\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">blucable<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>What do you even do with the attributes? this is very complex to use and there is no documentation regarding how to at least make your first product using this plugin.

There is simply nothing out there.  We found this and had some questions.  We contacted Teo and he gave us a 2 week trial key and we ended up purchasing it.    It works with woocommerce perfectly, but you might have to tweak things if you want tickets to display in pdf invoices or if your payment processor does not send back the payment confirmation.  We used paypal simple and had to manually check to send the completed order which added the ticket numbers.  We upgraded to paypal pro and it works automatically.  Not the fault of the raffle plugin, but something to think about.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great Plugin - and even better support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ackdev0218\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/564a8f5911b15fc5e5ba9c7151557f2f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/564a8f5911b15fc5e5ba9c7151557f2f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ackdev0218\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ackdev0218<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>We tried the free version to see if it worked for a customer.

Sent an email for support and it turns out it is 2 different versions between pro and free.  Support quickly got us up and running.   It works great.  Support is excellent.   We had concerns on how to pick a winner - what we will do is export the tickets and customer info to a csv and each ticket is on a row.  We will use Random.org to select a winner between 1 and [total tickets].  They plan on adding that feature but it is not available yet, but it is easy to do it this way as well.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Support is awsome<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/stuartdareukcom\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/57b379bc2c571e4ceff769ab6200d772?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/57b379bc2c571e4ceff769ab6200d772?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/stuartdareukcom\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">thebastion <small>(stuart@dare.uk.com)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Just wanted to leave a quick review to say that I purchased the pro plugin for 2 sites and whilst it didn't do what I needed the team at WP Ninja bent over backwards to customise it for me.<\/p>\n<p>They also asked for any other feedback to make the plugin better.<\/p>\n<p>What more can you ask?\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works beautifully!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/braz\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/14746509ee759a74200145af2e88b90c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/14746509ee759a74200145af2e88b90c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/braz\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">braz<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>Plugin work amazingly, does exactly what we needed.

The options within plugin are great because we can sell more tickets in 1 product if we want and use prefixes to help monitor what goes where on the back end. Plugin even easily prints ticket numbers on confirmation emails from woocommerce and continues to do the same even on subsequent emails coming from the system. Just marvelous!<br \/>\nWe had a small issue that had to do with our server, not the plugin itself, and the support we received was tremendous.<\/p>\n<p>Definitely worth the purchase!
