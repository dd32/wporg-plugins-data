Then something was done to the code that meant second language venues no longer display correctly, and you are forced to have all addresses in a single language. I am working welsh\/english, and welsh and english addresses ARE different. \nPrior to the update that caused the failure, it worked well. \nUnfortunately, despite starting again (several times) this cannot be rectified and the support is VERY unresponsive, pretty much refusing to acknowledge that (a) it used to work even though I could show them a working site pre-upgrade (b) that addresses should be different in different languages and (c) that the various plugins are no longer sensitive to the second language (showing either ALL or NONE) even though I have bent over backwards to provide access to test sites where things are not good. \nThey also will not provide any indication that the bugs they do acknowledge are on a fix list or give any estimated time to fix. \nTried getting WPML involved in this but they gave up fairly quickly.\nI am currently looking to move away from this product so that I can avoid paying again for what's far-from-premium support. It is not good enough to ignore customers.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Made my day<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/johanseidenfaden\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/074d9b6dac4f2a04474eab52565a33e2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/074d9b6dac4f2a04474eab52565a33e2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/johanseidenfaden\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">johan.seidenfaden<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>All my event lists showed everything twice (in both languages).

Duplicating them using WPML is enough.<\/p>\n<p>Given the flexibiltiy of both plugins, there is an huge number of possible setting\/language combinations to test, and despite our rigorous testing it is impossible to test every setting combination and scenario. To the best of our knowledge, we have achieved 100% compatibility, but should you come across on your setup and we&#8217;ll do our best to fix them as time permits.<\/p>\n",
