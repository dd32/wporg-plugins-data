Not anymore.<\/p>\n<p>When your contract isn\u2019t valid, there isn\u2019t much you can do to protect yourself.<\/p>\n<p>E-Signing has grown into a massive industry, giving way to a long list of rules and regulations that all documents must adhere to.<\/p>\n<p>If the validity of your contracts, invoices, or partner agreements were to come into question, the dangers are clear:  your entire business could be at risk.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re here to make sure that never happens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ApproveMe WP E-Signature Plugin for Formidable Forms turns your WordPress website into a court recognized legal document signing application.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, there is no doubt that Formidable Forms is an incredible plugin.  It\u2019s great at automating tasks and streamlining forms on your website&#8230; BUT, ensuring that all forms are legally binding is NOT their specialty.  Our plugin fills that void.<\/p>\n<p>This e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms ensures that every contract, form or invoice submitted with the plugin is 100% UETA\/ESIGN compliant.<\/p>\n<p>Never again will you have to question the legality of your forms or pay for a third-party signing service to feel secure.<\/p>\n<p>The ApproveMe team has invested a lot time and resources into building a system that plays nicely with the rules and regulations of any country where e-signing is used.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin gives you the power to control your user experience while staying fully protected.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=formidable-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click Here to Try Formidable Forms Signature Demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Other Signature Plugins &amp; Add-Ons<\/strong> simply record the details of signatures and submit the data to a web server.  The image file gets saved to your FTP server.  Sound safe?  It\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<p>That image file of your client\u2019s hand written legal signature is made easily accessible to FTP intruders.  Since most other plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA\/ESIGN compliant) you would have a serious problem if your files got in the hands of the wrong people.<\/p>\n<p>Fraud and identity theft become much bigger and more serious problems when your contracts are non-binding.  Why risk it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Powerful Features of ApproveMe\u2019s e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>UETA\/ESIGN Compliance<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We closely track all e-signature rules and regulations so that our plugin is always 100% compliant and up to date.  Rest easy knowing that any contract, form, or invoice signed with our plugin will stand up in front of a judge.<\/p>\n<p><em>Encrypted Data Storage<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We will never store any of your data on an FTP server.  We encrypt and store your data in different strategic locations within your database.  Every single thing from your document data to your custom input fields will be secure.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, if an FTP intruder even tried to unencrpyt any of your data, the entire document would destroy itself.  We don\u2019t mess around when it comes to security.<\/p>\n<p><em>Instantly Trigger Contracts<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to get your contracts signed?  Keep your clients from getting distracted.  Our plugin allows you to immediately redirect signers to your contract after they submit a form.<\/p>\n<p><em>Unique Signer Invitations<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let just anyone download your PDF documents.  We added an extra layer of security.  Only when the sender (you) is logged in and the signer uses their unique invitation can a signed PDF be downloaded.  Greatly reduces the risk of anyone unauthorized seeing your contract.<\/p>\n<p><em>Responsive Design<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now you and your clients can sign on the go with mobile signing.  Our plugin works seamlessly with all desktop and mobile browsers for Android and iOS including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dynamic Form Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dynamic form fields allow you to customize contracts based on your signer\u2019s info.  You can sync even the most complex form fields with your contracts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Signing Reminder Emails<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Need to give your client a gentle nudge?  Automatic reminder emails will make sure your contract gets signed.  You choose the trigger date and the frequency.<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You and your team are free to create as many contracts as you like.  Everyone on your team can access the plugin with no limits or hidden fees.

Approve Me&#8217;s Digital Signature is triggered once a Formidable Form is submitted.

Don\u2019t worry \u2014 your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.<br \/>\nThis is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your Formdiable Form.<\/p>\n<p>[esig formdiable formid=&#8221;3&#8243; field_id=&#8221;1&#8243; ]<\/p>\n<p>You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.

Not anymore.<\/p>\n<p>When your contract isn\u2019t valid, there isn\u2019t much you can do to protect yourself.<\/p>\n<p>E-Signing has grown into a massive industry, giving way to a long list of rules and regulations that all documents must adhere to.<\/p>\n<p>If the validity of your contracts, invoices, or partner agreements were to come into question, the dangers are clear:  your entire business could be at risk.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re here to make sure that never happens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ApproveMe WP E-Signature Plugin for Formidable Forms turns your WordPress website into a court recognized legal document signing application.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, there is no doubt that Formidable Forms is an incredible plugin.  It\u2019s great at automating tasks and streamlining forms on your website&#8230; BUT, ensuring that all forms are legally binding is NOT their specialty.  Our plugin fills that void.<\/p>\n<p>This e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms ensures that every contract, form or invoice submitted with the plugin is 100% UETA\/ESIGN compliant.<\/p>\n<p>Never again will you have to question the legality of your forms or pay for a third-party signing service to feel secure.<\/p>\n<p>The ApproveMe team has invested a lot time and resources into building a system that plays nicely with the rules and regulations of any country where e-signing is used.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin gives you the power to control your user experience while staying fully protected.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=formidable-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click Here to Try Formidable Forms Signature Demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Other Signature Plugins &amp; Add-Ons<\/strong> simply record the details of signatures and submit the data to a web server.  The image file gets saved to your FTP server.  Sound safe?  It\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<p>That image file of your client\u2019s hand written legal signature is made easily accessible to FTP intruders.  Since most other plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA\/ESIGN compliant) you would have a serious problem if your files got in the hands of the wrong people.<\/p>\n<p>Fraud and identity theft become much bigger and more serious problems when your contracts are non-binding.  Why risk it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Powerful Features of ApproveMe\u2019s e-signature Add-On for Formidable Forms:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>UETA\/ESIGN Compliance<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We closely track all e-signature rules and regulations so that our plugin is always 100% compliant and up to date.  Rest easy knowing that any contract, form, or invoice signed with our plugin will stand up in front of a judge.<\/p>\n<p><em>Encrypted Data Storage<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We will never store any of your data on an FTP server.  We encrypt and store your data in different strategic locations within your database.  Every single thing from your document data to your custom input fields will be secure.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, if an FTP intruder even tried to unencrpyt any of your data, the entire document would destroy itself.  We don\u2019t mess around when it comes to security.<\/p>\n<p><em>Instantly Trigger Contracts<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to get your contracts signed?  Keep your clients from getting distracted.  Our plugin allows you to immediately redirect signers to your contract after they submit a form.<\/p>\n<p><em>Unique Signer Invitations<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let just anyone download your PDF documents.  We added an extra layer of security.  Only when the sender (you) is logged in and the signer uses their unique invitation can a signed PDF be downloaded.  Greatly reduces the risk of anyone unauthorized seeing your contract.<\/p>\n<p><em>Responsive Design<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now you and your clients can sign on the go with mobile signing.  Our plugin works seamlessly with all desktop and mobile browsers for Android and iOS including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dynamic Form Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dynamic form fields allow you to customize contracts based on your signer\u2019s info.  You can sync even the most complex form fields with your contracts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Signing Reminder Emails<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Need to give your client a gentle nudge?  Automatic reminder emails will make sure your contract gets signed.  You choose the trigger date and the frequency.<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You and your team are free to create as many contracts as you like.  Everyone on your team can access the plugin with no limits or hidden fees.
