This plugin gives you complete subscriber management from within WordPress, without writing any code. But if you want to do your own customizations, the developer has created a system to allow you to do this easily without overwriting the core plugin files. The set of features is amazing and the developer and his company have provided fantastic support all along. I can't say enough good things about this plugin, and I would encourage anyone who needs to manage a significant quantity of print and online or online only to take a look at this. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Nice Features<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/imran5720\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b74c9162dd9f235a6ae243aa84830f55?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b74c9162dd9f235a6ae243aa84830f55?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/imran5720\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Billing Guru <small>(imran5720)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>This plugin provides some really nice features to sell subscription based contents online.
