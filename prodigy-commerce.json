        "description": "<p><a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prodigy Commerce<\/a> is the only hosted eCommerce platform for WordPress that\u2019s free at any scale. Prodigy\u2019s unique solution seamlessly blends WordPress&#8217;s superior CMS with a powerful platform to create an alternative to WooCommerce. Prodigy was built specifically for the WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies so that they can more easily build beautiful, secure, fully functional stores for their clients. Store owners gain access to a Shopify-like platform from which to manage their products and orders.<\/p>\n<p>The key benefits of Prodigy\u2019s solution include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires only ONE free open-source plugin<\/li>\n<li>Hosted platform is free at any scale<\/li>\n<li>Solid infrastructure and security<\/li>\n<li>Complete storefront design flexibility<\/li>\n<li>Shopify-like backend experience<\/li>\n<li>Multi-channel customer support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XcSXyPWyL7Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>HOW CAN FULLY FUNCTIONAL STORES BE BUILT WITH ONLY ONE FREE PLUGIN?<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s solution eliminates the complexity, security risks, and costs of WooCommerce\u2019s plugin and extension architecture by tightly integrating all essential functionality, and natively building premium features, into the platform. <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/integrations\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Integration partners<\/a> include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shipengine.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShipEngine<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taxjar.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TaxJar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/en\/solutions\/minfraud-services\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaxMind minFraud<\/a>, a handful of high-quality payment processors, <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Analytics<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/tools\/meta-pixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Pixel<\/a>. Natively built premium features currently include abandoned cart recovery and the ability to sell products and services on a subscription basis. No third-party services are needed to build fully functional stores.<\/p>\n<h4>WHY IS THE HOSTED PLATFORM FREE AT ANY SCALE?<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s business model is based solely upon revenue sharing agreements with the payment processors integrated into its platform, similar to Shopify\u2019s exclusive relationship with payments\u2019 facilitator Stripe. Prodigy, however, does not charge a subscription or app fees; it really is <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/why-free\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free<\/a> for the professionals who build stores and their store owner clients. There are no limits on the number of products, orders processed, sales generated, bandwidth or storage used, staff seats, or API requests. Payment processing rates start at the standard 2.9% + $0.30. For high-volume stores, Prodigy helps store owners negotiate lower rates and fees. Prodigy is perfectly aligned with a store owner\u2019s primary goal, generating sales.<\/p>\n<h4>SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s platform is hosted on <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AWS<\/a> and the checkout is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcisecuritystandards.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PCI-compliant<\/a>. WordPress is self-hosted; however, Prodigy provides every store with a free SSL\/TLS certificate. The combination of one plugin and a hosted platform not only reduces the complexity of building stores and their ongoing maintenance but also maximizes site speed and security.<\/p>\n<h4>COMPLETE STOREFRONT DESIGN FLEXIBILITY<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s plugin was built using WordPress conventions and standards. The templates can be overridden to create unique designs or popular themes and page builders, like <a href=\"https:\/\/elementor.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elementor<\/a> Pro, can be used.<\/p>\n<h4>SHOPIFY-LIKE BACKEND EXPERIENCE<\/h4>\n<p>Store owners manage their product catalog and daily <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/order-management\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">orders<\/a> on the platform, which is beautifully designed, intuitive, and easy to work with. WordPress is only used for its strengths: managing content and creating the storefront.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL CUSTOMER SUPPORT<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy provides free phone, email, and online chat support from California for the WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies and their store owner clients. Prodigy is the opposite of WooCommerce, never hiding behind a support forum and pretending that\u2019s customer service. The Prodigy team wants to communicate with, and proactively respond to any feedback received from, the members of the WordPress community and their store owner clients so that the solution can be continuously improved. Of course, a support forum is available via this plugin page and DIY support can be found via the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.prodigycommerce.com\/hc\/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center documentation<\/a> on Prodigy\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h4>A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO SHOPIFY AND BIGCOMMERCE TOO<\/h4>\n<p>The WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies now have a credible alternative to Shopify and BigCommerce since Prodigy is also a hosted solution but with a unique business model (free). Prodigy\u2019s platform is entirely merchant branded as soon as a store logo is uploaded, providing full control over the look-and-feel so that your store owner clients\u2019 customers have a seamless shopping experience from start to finish. Prodigy always prioritize the store owner\u2019s brand over its own.<\/p>\n<h4>YOUR CLIENTS OWN AND CONTROL THEIR STORE DATA<\/h4>\n<p>It should go without saying, but a store owner\u2019s data is their property. If a store owner wishes to migrate to a different platform, they can use the Prodigy product export tool and the Prodigy team will help them export all of their other content free-of-charge.<\/p>\n<h4>PARTNER WITH PRODIGY<\/h4>\n<p>Become a <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/partners\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prodigy partner<\/a> so that you can influence our development roadmap, share your client\u2019 pain points, and learn about financial incentives.<\/p>\n<h4>PRODIGY\u2019S PLUGIN FEATURES IN A NUTSHELL<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy&#8217;s plugin allows you to synchronize the product catalog from the Prodigy platform to the WordPress frontend and customize the storefront using WordPress conventions and standards.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronizes an unlimited number of products from the Prodigy platform as a custom post type<\/li>\n<li>Synchronizes product categories and tags from the Prodigy platform as custom taxonomies<\/li>\n<li>New and updated products are automatically synchronized when the site is on an accessible production server (manual sync available for development environments)<\/li>\n<li>Templates for catalog pages, product detail pages, and cart page that you can easily override and customize to meet your client\u2019s needs<\/li>\n<li>Use popular page builders, like <a href=\"https:\/\/elementor.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elementor<\/a> Pro. Prodigy\u2019s Elementor Pro integration contains a myriad of powerful Elementor widgets, and Elementor page templates, with conditions for displaying them in specific places. It has more features and widgets than what\u2019s offered in the WooCommerce Elementor plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Utilize powerful product search and attribute filter widgets in the store sidebar<\/li>\n<li>Products and Categories shortcodes allow you to create custom lists of products or categories on any page<\/li>\n<li>Customizer options available to help with simple customizations of the Catalog and Product detail pages<\/li>\n<li>Optional product ratings and reviews that can be moderated through the standard WordPress comments functionality<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>PRODIGY\u2019S PLATFORM FUNCTIONALITY IN A NUTSHELL<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy&#8217;s platform allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.prodigycommerce.com\/sign_up\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create a free developer account<\/a>, build an unlimited number of stores for your clients, and manage them all in one place.

Yeah, that was pretty much my experience with this plugin. No monthly fees? No additional fee on top of the payment processor fee? No charge for the plugin? Sounds good, but here is what happened when I tried to use it: \nProdigy will make you go through a very in-depth application process, where you will provide all kinds of information on your business to certify it is legit. Once you get through that, they will make you go through an application process with a payment processor that is even more in-depth (they don't tell you that upfront - its the surprise that's waiting for you.) In our case, even though we have been in business for 10+ years, regularly do business with the US government and Fortune 500, have Stripe and PayPal Pro accounts and have $1M+ in revenue, we were declined.\nWhy? The payment processor won't tell you. But I got an email from a Vice President at Prodigy who \"felt\" that it was because we provided information on our application that wasn't \"accurate\" or verifiable. He wanted us to apply again with a different payment processor and this time make sure that all of our information was \"accurate\" and \"verifiable.\" Bottom line: they have no idea why your application wasn't approved, but will assume you fudged something somewhere, I guess? Anyway, don't bother wasting your time, I say. If we couldn't get approved being the size business we are, I can't imagine Mom and Pop shops faring any better. And who needs the added aggravation of the Plugin maker telling you it's your fault? The problem is their business process which, while a great idea, isn't ready for prime-time - it's long, tedious and, in the end, completely opaque - even to them.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Do not install!

Store owners gain access to a Shopify-like platform from which to manage their products and orders.<\/p>\n<p>The key benefits of Prodigy\u2019s solution include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires only ONE free open-source plugin<\/li>\n<li>Hosted platform is free at any scale<\/li>\n<li>Solid infrastructure and security<\/li>\n<li>Complete storefront design flexibility<\/li>\n<li>Shopify-like backend experience<\/li>\n<li>Multi-channel customer support<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XcSXyPWyL7Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>HOW CAN FULLY FUNCTIONAL STORES BE BUILT WITH ONLY ONE FREE PLUGIN?<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s solution eliminates the complexity, security risks, and costs of WooCommerce\u2019s plugin and extension architecture by tightly integrating all essential functionality, and natively building premium features, into the platform. <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/integrations\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Integration partners<\/a> include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shipengine.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShipEngine<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taxjar.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TaxJar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.maxmind.com\/en\/solutions\/minfraud-services\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaxMind minFraud<\/a>, a handful of high-quality payment processors, <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Analytics<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/tools\/meta-pixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Pixel<\/a>. Natively built premium features currently include abandoned cart recovery and the ability to sell products and services on a subscription basis. No third-party services are needed to build fully functional stores.<\/p>\n<h4>WHY IS THE HOSTED PLATFORM FREE AT ANY SCALE?<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s business model is based solely upon revenue sharing agreements with the payment processors integrated into its platform, similar to Shopify\u2019s exclusive relationship with payments\u2019 facilitator Stripe. Prodigy, however, does not charge a subscription or app fees; it really is <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/why-free\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free<\/a> for the professionals who build stores and their store owner clients. There are no limits on the number of products, orders processed, sales generated, bandwidth or storage used, staff seats, or API requests. Payment processing rates start at the standard 2.9% + $0.30. For high-volume stores, Prodigy helps store owners negotiate lower rates and fees. Prodigy is perfectly aligned with a store owner\u2019s primary goal, generating sales.<\/p>\n<h4>SOLID INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s platform is hosted on <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AWS<\/a> and the checkout is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcisecuritystandards.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PCI-compliant<\/a>. WordPress is self-hosted; however, Prodigy provides every store with a free SSL\/TLS certificate. The combination of one plugin and a hosted platform not only reduces the complexity of building stores and their ongoing maintenance but also maximizes site speed and security.<\/p>\n<h4>COMPLETE STOREFRONT DESIGN FLEXIBILITY<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy\u2019s plugin was built using WordPress conventions and standards. The templates can be overridden to create unique designs or popular themes and page builders, like <a href=\"https:\/\/elementor.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elementor<\/a> Pro, can be used.<\/p>\n<h4>SHOPIFY-LIKE BACKEND EXPERIENCE<\/h4>\n<p>Store owners manage their product catalog and daily <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/order-management\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">orders<\/a> on the platform, which is beautifully designed, intuitive, and easy to work with. WordPress is only used for its strengths: managing content and creating the storefront.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL CUSTOMER SUPPORT<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy provides free phone, email, and online chat support from California for the WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies and their store owner clients. Prodigy is the opposite of WooCommerce, never hiding behind a support forum and pretending that\u2019s customer service. The Prodigy team wants to communicate with, and proactively respond to any feedback received from, the members of the WordPress community and their store owner clients so that the solution can be continuously improved. Of course, a support forum is available via this plugin page and DIY support can be found via the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.prodigycommerce.com\/hc\/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center documentation<\/a> on Prodigy\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h4>A CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO SHOPIFY AND BIGCOMMERCE TOO<\/h4>\n<p>The WordPress community of developers, designers, and agencies now have a credible alternative to Shopify and BigCommerce since Prodigy is also a hosted solution but with a unique business model (free). Prodigy\u2019s platform is entirely merchant branded as soon as a store logo is uploaded, providing full control over the look-and-feel so that your store owner clients\u2019 customers have a seamless shopping experience from start to finish. Prodigy always prioritize the store owner\u2019s brand over its own.<\/p>\n<h4>YOUR CLIENTS OWN AND CONTROL THEIR STORE DATA<\/h4>\n<p>It should go without saying, but a store owner\u2019s data is their property. If a store owner wishes to migrate to a different platform, they can use the Prodigy product export tool and the Prodigy team will help them export all of their other content free-of-charge.<\/p>\n<h4>PARTNER WITH PRODIGY<\/h4>\n<p>Become a <a href=\"https:\/\/prodigycommerce.com\/partners\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prodigy partner<\/a> so that you can influence our development roadmap, share your client\u2019 pain points, and learn about financial incentives.<\/p>\n<h4>PRODIGY\u2019S PLUGIN FEATURES IN A NUTSHELL<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy&#8217;s plugin allows you to synchronize the product catalog from the Prodigy platform to the WordPress frontend and customize the storefront using WordPress conventions and standards.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Synchronizes an unlimited number of products from the Prodigy platform as a custom post type<\/li>\n<li>Synchronizes product categories and tags from the Prodigy platform as custom taxonomies<\/li>\n<li>New and updated products are automatically synchronized when the site is on an accessible production server (manual sync available for development environments)<\/li>\n<li>Templates for catalog pages, product detail pages, and cart page that you can easily override and customize to meet your client\u2019s needs<\/li>\n<li>Use popular page builders, like <a href=\"https:\/\/elementor.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elementor<\/a> Pro. Prodigy\u2019s Elementor Pro integration contains a myriad of powerful Elementor widgets, and Elementor page templates, with conditions for displaying them in specific places. It has more features and widgets than what\u2019s offered in the WooCommerce Elementor plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Utilize powerful product search and attribute filter widgets in the store sidebar<\/li>\n<li>Products and Categories shortcodes allow you to create custom lists of products or categories on any page<\/li>\n<li>Customizer options available to help with simple customizations of the Catalog and Product detail pages<\/li>\n<li>Optional product ratings and reviews that can be moderated through the standard WordPress comments functionality<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>PRODIGY\u2019S PLATFORM FUNCTIONALITY IN A NUTSHELL<\/h4>\n<p>Prodigy&#8217;s platform allows you to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.prodigycommerce.com\/sign_up\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create a free developer account<\/a>, build an unlimited number of stores for your clients, and manage them all in one place.
