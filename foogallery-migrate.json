I've always wanted to move from Envira to FooGallery because of the tons of other awesome features and gallery templates that FooGallery has on the free version but was afraid to do so since I had tens of Envira galleries on my site that I did not want to go through the process of recreating again. However, with a few clicks, this plugin not only saved me hours of work but enabled me to fully migrate to the best WordPress gallery plugin by a country mile - FooGallery! Massive 5 stars from me! <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
