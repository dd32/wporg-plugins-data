For starters it is NOT user-friendly. Set up is complex and there is no easy way to register the pro version.  Contacting support also requires users to jump through hoops. Support doesn't seem to be based on a Ticket system so there's no auto response message. Response-time took more than a week. For a business that relies on having a functional booking system, there is no room for such delays. Also the developer offers no support forum.  These are vital flaws that the developer should address if they want to be a valid, competent, contender in the booking plugin market.  I would not recommend this product until the developers address these and other major issues.  Not sure who rated them with 5 stars, but in my opinion, 1 to 2 stars is more than accurately fair.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">UPDATE: I contacted Arraytics, the company name behind Timetics. I used their only form of ticket request, a basic support form on their website. They claim there is an email but it does not work. They promised a refund but have yet to deliver. Their support staff asked for very private data to be shared through the unsecured form. The support is not prompt, honest or professional. I would steer clear of this company until they vastly improve. The risks and costs to customers are too high.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Best Appointment Booking plugins<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/abdurrahmancm\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/599f09c3f6e952c1f2c000fa02066911?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/599f09c3f6e952c1f2c000fa02066911?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/abdurrahmancm\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">abdurrahmancm<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 4, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>arraytics is the best plugin for booking and appointments, I will recommend it for Small and Medium Businesses.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good start<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/springbreak\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/64fe76057426511a39cdcd1737f58f52?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/64fe76057426511a39cdcd1737f58f52?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/springbreak\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">springbreak<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 24, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It works fine, has a intuitive interface and good logic behind.
