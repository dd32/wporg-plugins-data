The MobiLoud Team made some customizations for us so that our mobile app had all the features that we wanted. They were very responsive and easy to work with.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Marile Borden, Founder, Moms Who Need Wine<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion this is the best service for creating your Android and iOS mobile apps. Really easy to configure and once you have done that, the mobile apps automatically get the content from your WordPress site. A great way to create an extra outlet for the content you already produce for your website. MobiLoud&#8217;s support is simply excellent. They will get your mobile app up and running in no time.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Antoine Holl, Founder, Broadcast Science<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;MobiLoud makes it really simple to create a good looking mobile app. MobiLoud also offers great support with prompt replies and good service to customizations for your mobile app. Overall we love it and would use it again.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Daniel McCullumm, Founder, Around Town Rotorua<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First and foremost, the support I have received from the MobiLoud team has been phenomenal. They have gone above and beyond basic support to even doing extra development to add features. Additionally, the MobiLoud mobile app platform is very easy to use and is an incredible tool to create native mobile apps from a WordPress site.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Kevin Trehan, North American Retail Hardware Association<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with MobiLoud was the best decision we took at launching our WordPress mobile app. Everything worked like a charm and I would recommend the service to anyone.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Fola Akinmolayan, Neo-2 Limited<\/em><\/p>\n",

The MobiLoud Team made some customizations for us so that our mobile app had all the features that we wanted.

Really easy to configure and once you have done that, the mobile apps automatically get the content from your WordPress site. A great way to create an extra outlet for the content you already produce for your website. MobiLoud&#8217;s support is simply excellent. They will get your mobile app up and running in no time.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Antoine Holl, Founder, Broadcast Science<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;MobiLoud makes it really simple to create a good looking mobile app. MobiLoud also offers great support with prompt replies and good service to customizations for your mobile app. Overall we love it and would use it again.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Daniel McCullumm, Founder, Around Town Rotorua<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First and foremost, the support I have received from the MobiLoud team has been phenomenal. They have gone above and beyond basic support to even doing extra development to add features. Additionally, the MobiLoud mobile app platform is very easy to use and is an incredible tool to create native mobile apps from a WordPress site.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Kevin Trehan, North American Retail Hardware Association<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Working with MobiLoud was the best decision we took at launching our WordPress mobile app. Everything worked like a charm and I would recommend the service to anyone.&#8221;<br \/>\n<em>Fola Akinmolayan, Neo-2 Limited<\/em><\/p>\n",
