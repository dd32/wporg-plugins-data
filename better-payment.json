I like to have it so the customer making the donation or payment is redirected to a custom thank you page, a certain URL. I can find no such feature. The admin email sent out is more of an advertisement for Better Payment Pro than about the information involved. When you are paying for a plugin, doesn't matter the cost, it should be more about you, your website, your information than an advertisement for the plugin. For whatever reason, right in the middle of the sent out admin email is a blue button that says \"View Transaction\". If you click on it, it takes you to the form you just filled out to make the donation or payment. I created a dump email account just to receive the admin emails. They are of no use to anyone. I needed a payment\/donation plugin quickly to replace a plugin that is being Sunset so I will use this plugin until I can find something better.
