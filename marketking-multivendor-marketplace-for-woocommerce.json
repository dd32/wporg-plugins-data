Not only that it has an amazing series of features within the plugin, the pricing of the plugin itself is very attractive with the amounts of features they are offering (Some of the features are built on-top of a purchased plugin hence there will be an additional cost required to purchase them if you need to use them, but nevertheless the features that MarketKing provided by the plugin itself is unbeatable in the market).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">As for the after-sales support of MarketKing, I would say that the support that I received are so good that it exceeds my expectation completely. Stefan and the team has been absolutely fantastic in providing support to help me in customising some of the features and outlook I required for my website. If you are a non-coder like myself, you will definitely love this plugin and the support that Stefan has provided. He has been providing codes to me for some customisation that I've request and that won't be achievable by myself without Stefan's help.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I believe this MarketKing plugin is the best multi-vendor plugin you can ask for in the market with its price, features and customer support. Consider yourself lucky if you've came across this plugin while you're still shopping for a plugin currently (at least that's what I thought). Finally, I wish MarketKing can keep growing and live up to its full potential. At the same time, wish that my business site will do well and I'll be able to keep supporting MarketKing in the long run.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing &amp; very good support (better than all the other multivendor plugins)<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/niikk\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec5f2291caa3df866487b269d2373ba8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ec5f2291caa3df866487b269d2373ba8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/niikk\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">niikk<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 23, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I currently have the pleasure of migrating from Dokan Multivendor to MarketKing, and I must say, it has been a breath of fresh air. MarketKing not only surpasses its competitors in terms of user experience and functionality but also boasts an exceptional support team.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing that caught my attention was the clean code and overall polished look of MarketKing. The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into creating a sleek and intuitive user interface. Navigating through the plugin is a breeze, and it provides a seamless experience for both administrators and vendors.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While MarketKing may not currently offer as many features as some of its competitors, its roadmap promises a steady stream of updates and improvements. This forward-thinking approach shows that the development team is committed to enhancing the plugin's capabilities over time. It's clear that MarketKing is poised to become a force to be reckoned with in the multivendor plugin market.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, let's talk about the support team, particularly Stefan. From the moment I reached out to them with inquiries and concerns, I was met with unparalleled responsiveness and expertise. Stefan's knowledge of the plugin is extensive, and he always goes the extra mile to ensure that all issues are resolved promptly. Their dedication to customer satisfaction is truly commendable.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having experienced the frustration of dealing with subpar support in the past, I can confidently say that MarketKing's team sets a new standard. They genuinely care about their customers' success and are committed to providing top-notch assistance at every step.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In summary, if you're in search of a multivendor plugin that combines excellent user experience, clean code, and a supportive team, MarketKing is the answer. While it may not have all the features of its more established competitors, its impressive roadmap and the dedication of the support team make it a no-brainer choice. Give MarketKing a try, and you won't be disappointed.

Some have been good, others, not so much. The team behind MarketKing, SalesKing, and B2BKing is something different. Their plugin itself is amazing, it has done a lot of which I didn't think would be possible by a simple plugin install, so right off the bat I was impressed, but I would run into a couple of areas where I would want an additional feature, or maybe something wasn't 100% compatible with one of my other plugins, so I reached out to support, and I was very surprised on the kind of interactions I got. They not only helped me with figuring out solutions to my questions, but would also help me by providing updates to their plugin that specifically impacted my work, and would provide me with snippets of code to help me develop the actions I was trying to accomplish. I normally don't write a review on things, unless it is a restaurant that just gave me the best meal I have had in years, but this plugin has impressed me, and so has the support and development team behind it, and I thought it was only fair for me to leave a 5-star review on it.

I predict this will be the &#8220;go to&#8221; marketplace platform in the next 6+ months..!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <em>&#8220;Bought it for $139, but it&#8217;s worth $1390.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <em>&#8220;This is one of the best multi vendor plugin, if not the best. I was using WCFM Ultimate plugin on my site &#8211; it&#8217;s a great plugin but it is cluttered. It also needs a lot of plugins for it to be fully functional. Plus, you will pay an annual fee to keep it going. WCFM also has a MASSIVE DATABASE FOOTPRINT &#8211; Creates about 36 tables on the database.

Dozens of modules are available to customize or enhance the features of this multi vendor plugin, the UX\/UI is amazing and it just works. The support is superior. The speed of development or bug fixing is super fast. Forget about the others like Dokan, WC Vendors and what else is existing. They lack in every criteria I described above since I used and tested each of them. This plugin is done thoroughly and with perfection in mind. I hope this plugin gets the attention and support it deserves.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 <em>&#8220;Awesome plugins! The customer support team is very supportive. I have purchased both MarketKing and B2BKing. I think this is the best deal to get an alternate of Dookan etc. All plugins are translatable and have a decent vendor dashboard. I will keep updating this review.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\ud83c\udf89 *&#8221;I run a membership site that is complicated. I&#8217;ve been looking for a Multi Vendor plugin for almost 2 years and I had my eyes set on Dokan Pro (Business level).
