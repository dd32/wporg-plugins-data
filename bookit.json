It is also a big minus that between booking you don't have an option for a break time. Also I have noticed if the booking appointments is a three hour long and it starts from 9 am - 12 pm.. than the other costumer has the option to book it from 10  am - 1 pm - which is not ok. If someone books the first hour, than you can not book until 12.15 pm. or 1 pm. This is why period time is needed, and so the other booking do not cover them selves up.
