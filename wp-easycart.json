WP Easy Cart consistently showed up in the results and had some high praise from users. What made the decision easy for me was Josh. Before I even downloaded the free version, Josh was quick to respond to my emails and countless questions. After purchasing the pro version, he was amazing in his support; guiding me through the setup process and even helped me with tips for customizing our reporting. This is an amazing cart system helmed by an amazing team. Josh is the best and you won't regret adding this plug-in to your site. If I could give more than 5 stars I definitely would!
