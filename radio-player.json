Here, you can also choose to display the sticky player only on specific pages by excluding them from the settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83c\udf10 Play HTTP Streams<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you want to play HTTP streams on your website, you need to enable the HTTP player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; HTTP Player Settings page.

Why isn&#8217;t the stream metadata  (like current track title, artist, and artwork)  appearing in the player?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the stream metadata isn&#8217;t appearing in the player, several factors might be responsible. Below are potential causes and troubleshooting steps:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presence of Metadata:<\/strong> First, ascertain if the stream even has metadata. If it doesn&#8217;t, the player can&#8217;t display details like the current song title.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Player Configuration:<\/strong> Ensure the &#8220;Show Track Title&#8221; option is activated within the player controls settings. This ensures that any available metadata gets displayed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Server Configuration &#8211; allow_url_fopen:<\/strong> The allow_url_fopen setting on the server must be enabled for the player to fetch the metadata from the stream. If you&#8217;re unsure about this setting, contact your web hosting provider. If you possess server access rights, you might be able to modify this setting yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Metadata Proxy Settings:<\/strong> If after the above steps the metadata remains undisplayed, consider activating the Metadata Proxy settings. This can typically be found under the HTTP player settings tab within the plugin settings page.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Further Assistance:<\/strong> Have you followed all the provided steps but still encounter issues?

If you need a single station and you are streaming on a https server - you're good to go. My problem is that I'm trying to stream multiple stations some https and most are http - so I had to purchase the proxy server. And still some of the stations do not play on the RadioPlayer even though I can get the stream to work on just about every other application. At first customer support was helpful, but I haven't heard from Prince in over a month. On a free plugin, I don't expect a prompt response. However, when I pay for a product, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect better service. So if the developer wants to help me as a customer, i will revise this review and add more stars to reflect accordingly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Do not purchase, Do not support this plugin<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/krimimaru\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f6b7a1aa44a48ceb371892085e9e51d2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f6b7a1aa44a48ceb371892085e9e51d2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/krimimaru\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">krimimaru<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 12, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The plugin doesnt work.

Here, you can enter the player details, such as the name, audio source, and player skin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udcbb Display the Player<\/strong><br \/>\nAfter adding a new player, you can display it on your website in various ways. The simplest way is to use the [radio_player id=&#8221;player_id&#8221;] shortcode, where player_id is the ID of the player you want to display. You can also display the player on any page or post by using the Radio Player Gutenberg block or Elementor widget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udccc Display the Sticky Player<\/strong><br \/>\nTo display the sticky player, you first need to select the player that you want to use as the sticky player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; Sticky Player Settings page. Here, you can also choose to display the sticky player only on specific pages by excluding them from the settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\ud83c\udf10 Play HTTP Streams<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you want to play HTTP streams on your website, you need to enable the HTTP player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; HTTP Player Settings page. Here, you can also specify the HTTP player buffer size and other settings.<\/p>\n<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily add and display a radio player on your WordPress website using the Radio Player plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>\ud83d\udd00  Radio Player Proxy Add-on<\/h3>\n<p>Recent updates in modern browsers have introduced stringent rules against mixed content.<br \/>\nAs a result, if a stream link isn&#8217;t SSL-encrypted but your website is, it won&#8217;t play.
