However, we highly recommend you follow our demo site and documenation to START with the core plugins and themes in our LaunchKit Demo sites. Why? Because this shows you how to have a common starting point with all the powerful features, yet not rely upon any premium 3rd party plugins or themes, or even add-on Gutenberg blocks. Once you&#8217;ve accomplishes your initial setup, you can then add &#8220;only&#8221; what you really need, and avoid building a Frankenstein Monster or adding every shiny new ball you see \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20plugins%20are%20important%20to%20use%20with%20launchkit%3F'>\nWhat plugins are important to use with LaunchKit?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>While you can substitute out many types of free plugins for others, such as one LMS for another, there are some really key plugins to use in order to achieve the results we offer in our free LaunchKit Demo Sites. We encourage you to launch your own free Demo Site to explore and learn more about what works for your particular needs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20use%20a%20page%20builder%20with%20launchkit%3F'>\nDo I need to use a page builder with LaunchKit?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The primary purpose of LaunchKit is to demonstrate how one can achieve a powerful business solution using only a free theme and the core Gutenberg blocks. However, if you WANT to add your favorite page builder, of course you can! The idea it to start with LESS and then add only what you want or need, instead of being overwhelmed at the start.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20sales%20funnels%20can%20i%20make%20with%20launchkit%3F'>\nHow many Sales Funnels can I make with LaunchKit?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>LaunchKit provides one instant registration flow and three custom product flows, with no configuration required. If you feel you want more features or complete control over unlimited funnels, custom checkout and product layouts and more, then you may consider upgrading to our LaunchFlows plugin. Even without an upgrade, however, you will be able to achieve the four most popular and necessary sales funnels required: LeadMagnet Onboarding (Instant Registration), Tripwire Product, Sample Product, Full Product<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20makes%20launchkit%20different%20from%20other%20plugins%20in%20the%20wordpress%20respository%3F'>\nHow makes LaunchKit different from other plugins in the WordPress respository?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>LaunchKit acts like the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; that takes the feature-limited capabilities of popular and powerful free plugins in the respository and combines them into a fully-functional solution when you follow our step-by-step instructions or use our free LaunchKit Demo Sites. This means that most people can achieve a fully functional business solution in minutes before spending a dime on upgrading to the paid versions. This helps one to clarify exactly which, if any, of the plugins should be upgraded, and in many cases the answer will be &#8220;none.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20gateways%20do%20launchkit%20support%3F'>\nWhat gateways do LaunchKit support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>LaunchKit works with ANY gateway that is compatible with WooCommerce. It does not change or modify WooCommerce in that regard. In our free LaunchKit Demo Sites we include free test-configurations for the most popular Stripe and PayPal so that you don&#8217;t even need to configure those in order to see how all the Sales Funnels and automations work! Once you are ready to setup your own business, simply enable whichever gateways you prefer and\/or connect your own Stripe or PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20kinds%20of%20sales%20funnels%20can%20i%20create%20with%20launchkit%3F'>\nWhat kinds of Sales Funnels can I create with LaunchKit?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>With LaunchKit you are not limited in any way.
