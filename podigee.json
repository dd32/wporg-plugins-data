You can click on &#8220;immediately&#8221; in the publish settings box and you will see, that the episode&#8217;s date is already saved here correctly. All you have to do to have this date also as post date: click on the selected day in the calendar (and then on &#8220;publish&#8221;). If you change the date after publishing the post, please keep in mind that this could (depending on your permalink structure) also change the URL of your post.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

Really handy to transfer all data from the RSS feed into the post. \n\nThe only thing that I am missing now is an auto-publish function. I have to wait until the episode is published, before I can update the Wordpress page. \nAs I take care of all the meta-data in the Podigee web-site, there is no real need for me to review the Wordpress post before publishing.\nWhich makes it more complicated, I cannot see finished Podigee episodes that are finished but have a publishing date in the future in Wordpress. If that was the case I could at least set a date to publish along with the Podigee publishing date. At the same time - since the RSS feed is the bridge, it is probably quite impossible to fix this. \n\nSmall feature request: I would like to be able to select the items that are taken over in the auto-post (my subtitle never changes for example but is then added into every post) \n\n \n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
