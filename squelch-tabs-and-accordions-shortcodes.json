        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20shortcodes%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat shortcodes are available?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes makes available 8 shortcodes: [accordions], [accordion], [haccordions], [haccordion], [tabs], [tab], [toggles] and [toggle]. The plural tags (accordions, haccordions, tabs, toggles) are wrappers that define the group of tabs or accordions. The singular shortcodes (accordion, haccordion, tab, toggle) represent the individual content items within each group.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Full instructions can be found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/squelchdesign.com\/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes<\/a> project home page on the Squelch Web Design website.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20look%20of%20the%20widgets%3F'>\nCan I change the look of the widgets?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin creates jQuery UI accordions and tabs, jQuery UI-compatible toggles, and the horizontal accordions have been set up to use jQuery UI themes by default. So changing the jQuery UI theme in use on the page will change the appearance of the widgets. To change the jQuery UI theme simply go to Appearance &gt; Tabs and Accordions and choose a theme from the drop-down menu.<\/p>\n<p>You can also style the widgets with your own custom CSS if you wish by using the .squelch-taas-override class, but that is beyond the scope of this FAQ.

As of version 0.3.7 it is possible to link to a tab. The easiest way to achieve this is to open the tab you want to link to and, if you take a look at the page address, it should change as you click the tab. If you copy and paste this address it should link directly to the tab you have chosen.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

Apparently this contravenes the WordPress.org directory guidelines, despite the fact that the guidelines seem to make no mention of jQuery anywhere and despite the fact there are a number of plugins in the directory that do exactly the same thing. In order to get the plugin relisted it was necessary to use the WordPress-hosted version of jQuery and package the jQuery UI theme files. As a result the plugin no longer works on WP&lt;3.5 and there&#8217;s not much I can do about that.<\/li>\n<li>When you upgrade WordPress you may find that none of your widgets work any more due to a change in version of jQuery. This is a WordPress.org enforced change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.3<\/h4>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code to add .squelch-taas-override was missing, added in.<\/li>\n<li>Enabled nested accordions.<\/li>\n<li>Selecting &#8220;no jQuery UI theme&#8221; was causing the front-end to attempt to pull in a theme named &#8216;none&#8217; from the CDN.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.2<\/h4>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoHeight was always on regardless of settings on the accordions shortcode. If you prefer the old behaviour then ensure you have autoHeight=&#8221;true&#8221; on the accordions shortcode.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.1<\/h4>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing necessary default data being set in the options table on upgrade.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><h4>0.2<\/h4>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added in lighter text for haccordion&#8217;s dark theme, was somehow missed out of 0.1.1<\/li>\n<li>Added subtabs, subsubtabs, subtab and subsubtab shortcodes to allow tabs in tabs up to 3 levels deep<\/li>\n<li>Added subhaccordions, subhaccordion, subsubhaccordions and subsubhaccordion shortcodes to allow nested horizontal accordions<\/li>\n<li>Added toggles and toggle shortcodes and created jQuery plugin to provide toggle functionality<\/li>\n<li>Added subtoggles, subtoggle, subsubtoggles and subsubtoggle shortocdes to allow nested toggles<\/li>\n<li>Created admin interface configuration page with theme switcher for jQuery UI themes<\/li>\n<li>All generated screen widgets get a class of squelch-taas-override to make overriding styles in themes easier<\/li>\n<li>Added option to allow jQuery and jQuery UI to not be loaded if desired<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><h4>0.1.1<\/h4>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin now works on older versions of WordPress down to 3.3<\/li>\n<li>pauseonhover attribute was being erroneously ignored<\/li>\n<li>Fixes for styles in certain themes that might interfere with the horizontal accordions<\/li>\n<li>Dark theme now has grey text in the content area by default to make it easy to use out of the box<\/li>\n<li>Scripts and styles loaded from Google CDN for performance<\/li>\n<li>Fix for WordPress 3.4.2 (and possibly lower)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

Even though it is very far from perfect, after the pain other developers put me through, I have to appreciate quality of this one.\n\n- Very fast, no content jumping\n- Content of tabs is within Wordpress posts thanks to properly done shortcodes, not like in most of plugins where 1 shortcode = 1 tab of content created in plugin's interface\n- Starting theme is good and neutral enough to actually suffice for most of websites\n- There is a multitude of other themes to be picked in plugin's settings\n\nNow the bad:\n- No built in responsiveness for horizontal tabs\n- No Font Awesome icons for tab titles\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\nCan't set things like font size, but it can easily be changed through CSS, so no problem for me. It's a bit misleading that settings are under Appearance menu and on installed plugins list there is no settings option for this plugin what at start led me to think there are no settings at all. I think that some preview of available themes would be nice, checking them one by one is quite a chore and I couldn't find any online source for these themes.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Couldn&#039;t get to work and support helped fix it.
