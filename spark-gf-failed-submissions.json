Well done dev team. Knowing which forms have submission failures can help greatly to ensure your forms are working correctly. Love how it works. Would have give it 5* if not for some minor (essential) item missing. Multiple failure submissions are now logged and there is no way to remove them from the DB which can lead to a bloated DB. Yes you can change the threshold but when you find multiple bots or genuine failed submissions come through it quickly bloats the DB. Good thing its uses INNODB as its structure. Having a simple select and delete options is definitely essential in my opinion. Also combine with that filtering i.e. by IP address (same IPs) you can quickly see which IP addresses failed submissions come from, identify them and blacklist them. Currently very cumbersome to identify the same IP etc. Hope the developers can update this awesome plugin with those 2 features :)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
