I easily set up automatic backups to regularly each month, as that is all I need.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The flexibility offered by this plugin is truly remarkable. The Everest Backup Plugin lets me back up my entire website, specific files, or just the database. You get to choose the backup methods you use most often. I go for the full backup.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Another aspect that I appreciate is the reliability of the backups. I've tested the restoration process multiple times, and each time, it worked flawlessly. Being able to quickly restore my website if anything goes wrong gives me great peace of mind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The plugin works with different storage options like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Amazon S3, making it more convenient.

After contacting the company, they were very friendly, but nothing had happened after weeks. When they offered help, I gave them access, and that was the last I heard from them.<br \/>There are still issues with the plugin, and it's hard to tell if it is working or just showing progress without results.<br \/>The sad part is that they no longer respond to messages.
