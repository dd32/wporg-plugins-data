This is important and explains why randomly you upgrade your security plugin and your site dies.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally you shouldn&#8217;t use this along side other Anti-SPAM plugins or security plugins. If there is a feature you need, please feel free to suggest it in the support forums.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='my%20server%20has%20a%20securiy%20firewall%2C%20why%20do%20i%20need%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nMy server has a securiy firewall, why do I need this plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is an application layer firewall, not a server\/network security firewall.  It is designed to interpret web calls to your site to look for attempts to circumvent it and gain unauthorized access.<\/p>\n<p>Your network security firewall is designed to restrict access to your server based on certain types of network traffic.  The Shield Security plugin is designed to restrict access to your site, based on certain types of web calls.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20ip%20security%20bypass%20list%20work%3F'>\nHow does the IP Security Bypass List work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any IP address that is on the whitelist will not be subject to <strong>any of the firewall security processing<\/strong>.  This setting takes priority over all other settings.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20ip%20bypass%20support%20ip%20ranges%3F'>\nDoes the IP Bypass support IP ranges?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

We actively <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/FernleafSystems\/wp-simple-firewall\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">develop our plugin on Github<\/a> and the best thing you can do is submit pull request and bug reports which we&#8217;ll review.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20pages%2Fparameters%20whitelist%20work%3F'>\nHow does the pages\/parameters whitelist work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is a comma-separated list of pages and parameters. A NEW LINE should be taken for each new page name and its associated parameters.<\/p>\n<p>The first entry on each line (before the first comma) is the page name. The rest of the items on the line are the parameters.<\/p>\n<p>The following are some simple security examples to illustrate:<\/p>\n<p><strong>edit.php, featured<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the edit.php page, the parameter with the name &#8216;featured&#8217; will be ignored.<\/p>\n<p><strong>admin.php, url, param01, password<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any parameters that are passed to the page ending in &#8216;admin.php&#8217; with the names &#8216;url&#8217;, &#8216;param01&#8217; and &#8216;password&#8217; will<br \/>\nbe excluded from the firewall processing.<\/p>\n<p>*, url, param, password<\/p>\n<p>Putting a star first means that these exclusions apply to all pages.  So for every page that is accessed, all the parameters<br \/>\nthat are url, param and password will be ignored by the firewall.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20login%20cooldown%20security%20feature%20work%3F'>\nHow does the login cooldown security feature work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login Cooldown Security prevents more than 1 login attempt to your site every &#8220;so-many&#8221; seconds.  So if you enable a login cooldown of 60 seconds, only 1 login attempt will be processed every 60 seconds.  If you login incorrectly, you wont be able to attempt another login for a further 60 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>This security system completely blocks any level of brute-force login attacks and a cooldown of just 1 second goes a long way to adding security to your WordPress login.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/2t\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More Info<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20gasp%20login%20guard%20work%3F'>\nHow does the GASP Login Guard work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is best <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/2u\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">described on the blog<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%202-factor%20authentication%20security%20work%3F'>\nHow does the 2-factor authentication security work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>2-Factor Authentication <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/2v\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">is best described here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20not%20receiving%20the%20email%20with%202fa%20verification%20code.%3F'>\nI&#8217;m not receiving the email with 2FA verification code.?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Email delivery is a huge problem with WordPress sites and is very common.<\/p>\n<p>Your WordPress is not designed to send emails.

Real security is stopping attackers dead, before they hack your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Security Features At A Glance<\/h3>\n<h3>Bad Bot Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Bad bots are you&#8217;re #1 security threat. They account for 99.99% all WordPress security probes, attacks, injections, malware and vulnerability exploitation.<\/p>\n<p>Malicious bots can&#8217;t be bargained with, can&#8217;t be reasoned with; they don&#8217;t feel pity or remorse or fear, and they absolutely will not stop.<\/p>\n<p>Detecting them, and them blocking their access, is the key to powerful security that works. Prevention, when it comes to WordPress security, is cheaper, faster and much less stressful than <strong>cure<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Activity Log Coverage<\/h3>\n<p>When something goes wrong, you need to know why. Shield&#8217;s Activity Log module is a best-in-class logging appliance. It logs activity for every possible action by users and visitors, and even detects changes to your site, users, plugins and themes, when they occur directly on your database (outside of WordPress).<\/p>\n<h3>Limit Login and Registration Forms Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Our exclusive bot detection technology is invisible to users and visitors, so you don&#8217;t need any Google reCAPTCHA or CloudFlare Turnstile security addons on your site. Shield protects WordPress login, registration and lost password forms from brute force attacks, and eliminates user registration SPAM from bots.<\/p>\n<h3>Two-Factor Authentication for all users<\/h3>\n<p>Two-Factor Authentication is a key component of WordPress user security. It protects against account theft, takeover, and sharing. Shield supports email-based login code, Google\/Microsoft\/Lastpass Authenticator, Yubikey One-Time Passwords and U2F (ShieldPRO).<\/p>\n<h3>Exclusive Security Admin Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does Shield Security protect your WordPress site, it also provides security against tampering of key WordPress options and the Shield Security plugin itself. With Shield&#8217;s exclusive Security Admin feature, you can lockdown the security plugin from other admins to prevent accidental or malicious changes that will impact your security.<\/p>\n<h3>CrowdSec Partnership<\/h3>\n<p>Shield is the only WordPress security plugin to form strategic partnerships to bring powerful protection to your WordPress sites. With our CrowdSec integration, your WordPress sites benefit from crowd-sourced IP Block Lists so your site can block malicious bots before they can do any damage.<\/p>\n<h3>All The Features You&#8217;ll Absolutely Love<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Exclusive <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ju\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AntiBot Detection Engine Security<\/a> &#8211;

This involves analysing different security bot-signals and combining them to identify a visitor as malicious.<\/p>\n<p>These security signals include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>site probes that generate 404 errors<\/li>\n<li>failed logins<\/li>\n<li>logins with invalid usernames<\/li>\n<li>xml-rpc access<\/li>\n<li>fake search engine web crawlers<\/li>\n<li>invalid user agents<\/li>\n<li>excessive website requests and resource abuse<\/li>\n<li>and many more signals our security team have identified.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Early identification and blocking of malicious bots reduces your WordPress site&#8217;s vulnerability to any sort of attack.<\/p>\n<h4>Key Strategy #2: Hacking Cure<\/h4>\n<p>Even with the best security efforts, a site can get hacked. This usually involves file modification: either a hack file is added, or a file is changed.<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 key WordPress assets whose files can be hacked:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>WordPress Core<\/li>\n<li>WordPress Plugins<\/li>\n<li>WordPress Themes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Almost every security plugin can now do #1 &#8211; it&#8217;s easy because WordPress.org provides <em>file fingerprints<\/em> for core files.<\/p>\n<p>But, there are no hashes available for plugins and themes, so they can&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n<p>Shield is <strong>the only WordPress security plugin<\/strong> that offers full and accurate detection of file modifications for plugins and themes because we <strong>build our own file fingerprints<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security can compare the file contents of every plugin &amp; theme in the WordPress.org repository, looking for changed or new files<\/p>\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re a ShieldPRO client, you can protect premium plugins\/themes too, including Yoast SEO and Advanced Custom Fields Pro.<\/p>\n<p>Where possible, Shield Security will repair any unrecognised\/modified files it detects.<\/p>\n<h4>Shield makes Security easy<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason for your WordPress security to be so complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security is the easiest security plugin to setup &#8211; you simply activate it and off you go! As you learn more, you can tweak the settings to suit your needs.<\/p>\n<h4>Non-stop Security Notifications Are Not Okay.<\/h4>\n<p>Your security plugin must be smarter, and take responsibility for decisions so you don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security handles many problems for you, making intelligent security decisions without noisy email notifications.<\/p>\n<h3>Dedicated Premium Security Support When You Go PRO<\/h3>\n<p>The Shield Security team prioritises email technical support over the WordPress.org forums.<br \/>\nIndividual, dedicated technical support is only available to customers who have <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ab\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchased Shield Pro<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Discover all the advantages of switching your WordPress security Pro at <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ab\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our Shield Security store<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

I never had the intention to let down the work spent on creating such helpful plugin. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Clarify my doubt which I tested. Lets say at 12.00 PM a user IP is blocked for 1 day. After 12 hours later, when I as a user refresh the page , the page still says Restrictions lifted - 23 hours from now. There is no timer countdown to show the actual time left and the 24 hour ban will continue again if user refresh the page after 12 hours ? The Access Restricted page must show the real time left for restriction. Can you clarify this ?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Tried to test the offenses to check what happens after it hits the limit. For this I tried to spam the comment more than 10 times to trigger the cool down period. Offense limit was default 10 which I didn't change, I hit this limit , got redirected to Shield page saying IP restricted which is good. The IP block is set 24 hours.  Now help me understand, why after certain seconds, the IP which was blocked is able to access the website again. I was able to spam comments again got same IP restriction page, and now my offenses is 12. In a normal scenario if IP is banned for 24 hours, the same IP restrict message must be shown for total ban time and offense counter should not exceed the set threshold which is 10 in this case, not sure why after certain seconds I was able to access the page and spam again. If this is how your plugin works, I am afraid it has loopholes and bots can spam again and again as the IP ban does not work at all. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Too bad there is no way to write a direct message as only pro users support is available which limits such reporting with screenshots.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rnvibe\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/abc9bbc4aab638bc69e0c1df7788acbb?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/abc9bbc4aab638bc69e0c1df7788acbb?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rnvibe\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Camila Von Malice <small>(rnvibe)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 18, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I had installed and uninstalled 5 different security plugins for my site prior to finding this perfect plugin.

This isn't a new security app however the attention to its development, and efforts to continually improve this product is commendable and rare.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excellent<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/serge023\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e8e96fbcec6dbd84b70dabad70bbbb3c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e8e96fbcec6dbd84b70dabad70bbbb3c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/serge023\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">serge023<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 8, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Best firewall plugin by far<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excellent Support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/harveytw\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a3c503cdbc5a4ac3a4073cc75827b63e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a3c503cdbc5a4ac3a4073cc75827b63e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/harveytw\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">harveytw<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 19, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Amazing response time.

    "description": "<p>Bad Bots Are Your #1 Security Threat. Real security is stopping attackers dead, before they hack your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Security Features At A Glance<\/h3>\n<h3>Bad Bot Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Bad bots are you&#8217;re #1 security threat. They account for 99.99% all WordPress security probes, attacks, injections, malware and vulnerability exploitation.<\/p>\n<p>Malicious bots can&#8217;t be bargained with, can&#8217;t be reasoned with; they don&#8217;t feel pity or remorse or fear, and they absolutely will not stop.<\/p>\n<p>Detecting them, and them blocking their access, is the key to powerful security that works. Prevention, when it comes to WordPress security, is cheaper, faster and much less stressful than <strong>cure<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Activity Log Coverage<\/h3>\n<p>When something goes wrong, you need to know why. Shield&#8217;s Activity Log module is a best-in-class logging appliance. It logs activity for every possible action by users and visitors, and even detects changes to your site, users, plugins and themes, when they occur directly on your database (outside of WordPress).<\/p>\n<h3>Limit Login and Registration Forms Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Our exclusive bot detection technology is invisible to users and visitors, so you don&#8217;t need any Google reCAPTCHA or CloudFlare Turnstile security addons on your site. Shield protects WordPress login, registration and lost password forms from brute force attacks, and eliminates user registration SPAM from bots.<\/p>\n<h3>Two-Factor Authentication for all users<\/h3>\n<p>Two-Factor Authentication is a key component of WordPress user security. It protects against account theft, takeover, and sharing. Shield supports email-based login code, Google\/Microsoft\/Lastpass Authenticator, Yubikey One-Time Passwords and U2F (ShieldPRO).<\/p>\n<h3>Exclusive Security Admin Protection<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does Shield Security protect your WordPress site, it also provides security against tampering of key WordPress options and the Shield Security plugin itself. With Shield&#8217;s exclusive Security Admin feature, you can lockdown the security plugin from other admins to prevent accidental or malicious changes that will impact your security.<\/p>\n<h3>CrowdSec Partnership<\/h3>\n<p>Shield is the only WordPress security plugin to form strategic partnerships to bring powerful protection to your WordPress sites. With our CrowdSec integration, your WordPress sites benefit from crowd-sourced IP Block Lists so your site can block malicious bots before they can do any damage.<\/p>\n<h3>All The Features You&#8217;ll Absolutely Love<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Exclusive <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ju\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AntiBot Detection Engine Security<\/a> &#8211;

With Shield Security, your site will immediately to block visitors as they probe your site looking for vulnerabilities, and before they can do damage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No other standalone WordPress security plugin<\/strong> (including <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/shieldvswordfence\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wordfence<\/a>, WP Cerber, Ninja Firewall, All-In-One Security) approaches security in this way. The 1st step in any good security system is Intrusion Detection\/Prevention, the 2nd step is repair. Shield Security does both.<\/p>\n<p>Our mission is to block bad IPs and requests before they can do any damage. Shield Security will block all automated Comment SPAM, brute force logins, plugin-vulnerability exploitation, malware injection, vulnerability scanning, password stuffing, contact form spam, and so much more.  If you&#8217;re disappointed with the performance of your current security solution, give Shield Security a try &#8211; we promise that you won&#8217;t be disappointed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use the power of the network<\/strong>. ShieldNET is our new and exclusive network-based security intelligence platform that draws-in information from all around the globe to help Shield Security be smarter when assessing security threats and taking appropriate action. And with our new <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/l5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CrowdSec Security Partnership<\/a> you&#8217;ve got even more data to make smarter security decisions.<\/p>\n<h4>Get the highest rated 5* Security Plugin for WordPress<\/h4>\n<p>Per download, Shield Security <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/jl\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">has the highest 5* rating<\/a> in the WordPress plugin repository.<\/p>\n<h3>Leave Behind the Security Marketing Hype and Scare Mongering<\/h3>\n<p>Our Security solution isn&#8217;t designed to scare you and make you feel unsafe. We&#8217;ll never try to scare you.<\/p>\n<h3>2 Key WordPress Security Strategies<\/h3>\n<p>Shield Security uses 2 simple key strategies to protect your WordPress sites:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Intrusion Prevention System &#8211; Detect Bots\/Malicious IPs that will try to hack and invade your WordPress sites.<\/li>\n<li>Cure &#8211; Block Bad Bots and Repair Hacks<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Key Security Strategy #1: Hacking Prevention<\/h4>\n<p>Bad Bots are the primary cause for nearly all our security troubles &#8211; they&#8217;re relentless, automatic and powerful.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security is highly focused on their detection and eradication from your WordPress sites.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking malicious bots before they do damage through malware and exploitation of vulnerabilities is the #1 security strategy to protect and enhance security on a WordPress site.<\/p>\n<p>Shield detects these malicious visitors, then blocks their access to your site completely. This involves analysing different security bot-signals and combining them to identify a visitor as malicious.<\/p>\n<p>These security signals include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>site probes that generate 404 errors<\/li>\n<li>failed logins<\/li>\n<li>logins with invalid usernames<\/li>\n<li>xml-rpc access<\/li>\n<li>fake search engine web crawlers<\/li>\n<li>invalid user agents<\/li>\n<li>excessive website requests and resource abuse<\/li>\n<li>and many more signals our security team have identified.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Early identification and blocking of malicious bots reduces your WordPress site&#8217;s vulnerability to any sort of attack.<\/p>\n<h4>Key Strategy #2: Hacking Cure<\/h4>\n<p>Even with the best security efforts, a site can get hacked. This usually involves file modification: either a hack file is added, or a file is changed.<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 key WordPress assets whose files can be hacked:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>WordPress Core<\/li>\n<li>WordPress Plugins<\/li>\n<li>WordPress Themes<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Almost every security plugin can now do #1 &#8211; it&#8217;s easy because WordPress.org provides <em>file fingerprints<\/em> for core files.<\/p>\n<p>But, there are no hashes available for plugins and themes, so they can&#8217;t do it.<\/p>\n<p>Shield is <strong>the only WordPress security plugin<\/strong> that offers full and accurate detection of file modifications for plugins and themes because we <strong>build our own file fingerprints<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security can compare the file contents of every plugin &amp; theme in the WordPress.org repository, looking for changed or new files<\/p>\n<p>And, if you&#8217;re a ShieldPRO client, you can protect premium plugins\/themes too, including Yoast SEO and Advanced Custom Fields Pro.<\/p>\n<p>Where possible, Shield Security will repair any unrecognised\/modified files it detects.<\/p>\n<h4>Shield makes Security easy<\/h4>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason for your WordPress security to be so complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security is the easiest security plugin to setup &#8211; you simply activate it and off you go! As you learn more, you can tweak the settings to suit your needs.<\/p>\n<h4>Non-stop Security Notifications Are Not Okay.<\/h4>\n<p>Your security plugin must be smarter, and take responsibility for decisions so you don&#8217;t have to.<\/p>\n<p>Shield Security handles many problems for you, making intelligent security decisions without noisy email notifications.<\/p>\n<h3>Dedicated Premium Security Support When You Go PRO<\/h3>\n<p>The Shield Security team prioritises email technical support over the WordPress.org forums.<br \/>\nIndividual, dedicated technical support is only available to customers who have <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ab\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchased Shield Pro<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Discover all the advantages of switching your WordPress security Pro at <a href=\"https:\/\/shsec.io\/ab\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our Shield Security store<\/a>.<\/p>\n",
