We improved automatic cleanup of the plugin cache. The problem should be solved now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.10.4 &#8211; Aug 11, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the integration with the Yoast SEO plugin.<\/strong> There was a minor SEO issue with duplicates of the Open Graph tags on ecommerce store pages.

If your ecommerce site is running on an outdated PHP version, this update might fix a error message for you. Please update your PHP as soon as possible (or ask your hoster to do that for you) \u2014 it\u2019s much more secure to use the latest versions of software on your server.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.10.1 &#8211; Jun 15, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor improvements for the store dashboard menu items in the WordPress admin backend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.10 &#8211; Jun 08, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with the Elementor page builder.<\/strong> Elementor is one of the most popular page builders. We added Elementor support to Ecwid, so you can add online store functionality to your site pages in Elementor. We added two ecommerce widgets to the Elementor toolbar: the store home page to display the whole storefront and the buy now button to add buy buttons to pages and posts. To try the new widgets, open the Elementor editor in your WordPress admin backend and find the &#8220;Ecwid Store&#8221; section there.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.7 &#8211; May 19, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the Yoast SEO plugin. There was a minor SEO issue with duplicates of the canonical tag on ecommerce store pages. The issue has been fixed and everything should work fine now.<\/li>\n<li>After the last release, the Storefront menu item did not display in the plugin settings in the WP admin. That didn\u2019t affect the store functionality, all the storefront settings and data stayed intact. We fixed the Storefront menu item \u2014 you can navigate to the WordPress admin &gt; Ecwid &gt; Storefront and manage your store appearance as usual.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.6 &#8211; May 14, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve compatibility with the Elementor page builder plugin. Ecwid storefronts on Elementor-powered websites loaded slowly on devices with an old iOS version (less than 13.3.1). We fixed it and now stores should work well. <\/li>\n<li>Better warning messages for the site administrator about the hosting connection issues. Some hosting do not allow WordPress plugins connect external services and APIs in their code. That might be because of a hosting server misconfiguration or a tricky firewall setup. Good news is that the Ecwid plugin would work well even in such environment \u2014 you can add a store to your ecommerce site pages and sell. But some of the plugin feature would be disabled. For example, SEO tools wouldn&#8217;t work and the embedded store control panel wouldn&#8217;t show. We added extra warning messages and fallbacks to the plugin code to better handle such situations. If you face such a problem, we recommend contacting your hosting provider to make sure your server can connect the Ecwid API. <\/li>\n<li>Minor improvements for Twenty Twenty and NewShop themes.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.5 &#8211; Apr 21, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.4 &#8211; Apr 15, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the All in SEO plugin.

We fixed a PHP warning message (&#8220;call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback&#8221;), which appeared on some sites.<\/li>\n<li>Several changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace requirements.<\/li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.2 &#8211; Apr 06, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with the RankMath SEO plugin.<\/strong> The \u201cRankMath\u201d plugin is a tool to set SEO meta tags on site pages and to generate a sitemaps. It conflicted with the Ecwid SEO functions: SEO tags and sitemaps generated by Ecwid did not work well with those generated by RankMath. It\u2019s now fixed so if you use the plugin, everything should work fine and Google will index your products pages properly.<\/li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with WPBakery editor and UrbanGo Listing theme.<\/li>\n<li>Improvements for the &#8220;Import from WooCommerce&#8221; tool.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9.1 &#8211; Feb 21, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (&#8220;Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError &#8230;&#8221;). This error is reproduced when the hook &#8220;apply_filters (&#8216;the_title&#8217;, string $title, int $id)&#8221; with one parameter is called in the code. According to the documentation, for this hook you need to pass two parameters. We added an additional check to eliminate the error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>6.9 &#8211; Feb 20, 2020<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Storefront Settings page in the WordPress admin panel (WordPress admin &gt; Ecwid &gt; Storefront)<\/strong>. The storefront page on your site is what your customers see when they want to visit your shop. That&#8217;s the home of your ecommerce store. In this major update, we made it easier for you to manage that page \u2014 the new &#8220;Storefront&#8221; section in your dashboard has everything you need to do that.
