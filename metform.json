day it stopped. The only reason i know that is because my customer call me and told ne that the form is giving him an error. So i tried see what is going on, did some updated and it started working. in next 24 hour the same problem. I contacted customer support. In two days i received instruction what should i do and i did check all steps. But here it is again, the same problem. But what is worst is that the support takes 24 hours to respond to you questions and do not offer to have a conversation in order to solve the problem! every time you have a question you need to wait minimum 24 hours to get respond.
