You can then send these out directly or assign them to specific tasks, such as WooCommerce emails or the built-in send events.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the perfect tool for creating an email list, email subscription or newsletter signup, and for those looking to strengthen their CRM (customer relationship management) email toolset. You can schedule emails to send at any time and then track the email statistics after it is sent. The included templates, as well as the email builder tool, create a responsive email that will look good when opened on any device<\/p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Email Sending<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with a suite of built-in WooCommerce email integration features, which give you the ability to send emails to WooCommerce users on your site, including specific subsets of WooCommerce users (e.g. previous purchasers of a certain product), and also to create automatic WooCommerce email send triggers for specific WooCommerce actions (e.g. WooCommerce email to a someone who has an abandoned cart, new product added in WooCommerce, etc.). WooCommerce email sending features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send WooCommerce emails to past purchasers of specific products or products within a specific category<\/li>\n<li>Mix and match this with custom lists you&#8217;ve created for targeted WooCommerce emails. The perfect CRM for WooCommerce!<\/li>\n<li>Assign a specific email to send to users when a new WooCommerce product is added<\/li>\n<li>Automatically email users who have an abandoned cart, to help boost WooCommerce conversions<\/li>\n<li>Send an automatic email a specific amount of time after a WooCommerce purchase (e.g. as a follow up or requesting a review, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail has many WooCommerce and non WooCommerce email sending features that make it the ideal choice for someone who is looking for an easy way to compose and send emails out to their registered WordPress users and WooCommerce customers. It will help you improve your CRM workflow and experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Send Events<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with the ability to set up send events. These are triggers that will automatically send out a notification when something specific happens on your site. There are many available send events, including the WooCommerce features mentioned above as well site-specific triggers like when a profile is updated, a password is changed, a new post is published, a new comment is created, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You can assign any email that you have created in the plugin to each send event. You could even create multiple send events for the same trigger and assign multiple different notifications to them. The possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n<p>Available send actions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New user registration<\/li>\n<li>When a user profile is updated<\/li>\n<li>When a user role changes<\/li>\n<li>When a user password is reset<\/li>\n<li>After a specified amount of time that a user has not logged in<\/li>\n<li>When a new post is published<\/li>\n<li>When a there is a new comment<\/li>\n<li>A specified amount of time after a WooCommerce cart has been abandoned<\/li>\n<li>When a WooCommerce product is purchased<\/li>\n<li>A specified amount of time after a WooCommerce purchase<\/li>\n<li>When a new WooCommerce product is added<\/li>\n<li>When a WooCommerce subscription is purchased\/created<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Email Logging<\/h4>\n<p>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin also includes a powerful email logging tool. This logs not only the emails sent by the plugin itself, but all emails sent out from your WordPress. This is invaluable for knowing whether or not your messages are getting through and, if not, why. The details included in the log are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email status (e.g. success, failure, failure reason)<\/li>\n<li>Subject<\/li>\n<li>Recipient<\/li>\n<li>Send date<\/li>\n<li>Output of the email content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We have also included an option to <strong>send a notification to the admin whenever the log detects that an email has failed to send<\/strong>. You can customize this message with your own content and dynamic template tags that will automatically include pertinent information about the failed email.<\/p>\n<h4>SMTP<\/h4>\n<p>We have also included the ability for you to <strong>add in your own SMTP information for email sending<\/strong>. With this you can send emails from your real email address\/server\/host.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress users often find that automatic emails sent from their site fail to get to the recipient. This is usually because they are blocked or flagged as spam. If you have checked the logs and noticed the emails are being sent, but not received, then it&#8217;s usually a good idea to use the SMTP feature to send emails via your real address. This will greatly reduce the chance of them getting blocked.<\/p>\n<p>The following SMTP info can be entered\/customized:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SMTP host<\/li>\n<li>Encryption type<\/li>\n<li>Port number<\/li>\n<li>Email address authentication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will also find options that let you <strong>specify the from name and address<\/strong> for your automatic emails.<\/p>\n<h4>Subscription Interests<\/h4>\n<p>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin also comes with the ability for you to let users choose different interests for which they can receive notification updates. This can be added to the user profile page and the user registration form. You can also added anywhere else on your site using the handy included <strong>Subscription Interests Gutenberg block<\/strong> or <strong>shortcode<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Here they can choose from the following interests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce product categories<\/li>\n<li>Post categories<\/li>\n<li>Unique Ultimate WP Mail categories, which you can include in the plugin and utilize for custom emails<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a user has selected any subscription interest, they will automatically receive a notification when that event happens (new product or post is published, etc.).<\/p>\n<h4>Additional Features<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with a number of other advanced email sending features that will help you make your email management and email sending as efficient and effective as possible. Additional features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>User statistics that show the number of emails opened and links clicked<\/li>\n<li>Email categories, which can be used in combination with user lists to create well-targeted emails<\/li>\n<li>Option to automatically include an unsubscribe link in emails<\/li>\n<li>Styling options to further refine the look of your emails (email background color, email text alignment, email block styling)<\/li>\n<li>Labelling options, so you can change the text of elements like the subscribe and unsubscribe links as well as the subscription interests form <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The emails created in and by Ultimate WP Mail are all responsive emails. If you are looking for a tool that will help you send out mobile emails or help with your mobile CRM setup, this is it. A perfect complement to your current email marketing efforts, you can send a bulk email or mass email to any or all users. And, with the included newsletter signup email widget, you can get new users and email subscribers effortlessly.<\/p>\n<p>Set up WooCommerce reminders and WooCommerce notifications, as well as email reminders for other elements.

You can schedule emails to send at any time and then track the email statistics after it is sent. The included templates, as well as the email builder tool, create a responsive email that will look good when opened on any device<\/p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Email Sending<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with a suite of built-in WooCommerce email integration features, which give you the ability to send emails to WooCommerce users on your site, including specific subsets of WooCommerce users (e.g. previous purchasers of a certain product), and also to create automatic WooCommerce email send triggers for specific WooCommerce actions (e.g. WooCommerce email to a someone who has an abandoned cart, new product added in WooCommerce, etc.). WooCommerce email sending features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send WooCommerce emails to past purchasers of specific products or products within a specific category<\/li>\n<li>Mix and match this with custom lists you&#8217;ve created for targeted WooCommerce emails. The perfect CRM for WooCommerce!<\/li>\n<li>Assign a specific email to send to users when a new WooCommerce product is added<\/li>\n<li>Automatically email users who have an abandoned cart, to help boost WooCommerce conversions<\/li>\n<li>Send an automatic email a specific amount of time after a WooCommerce purchase (e.g. as a follow up or requesting a review, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail has many WooCommerce and non WooCommerce email sending features that make it the ideal choice for someone who is looking for an easy way to compose and send emails out to their registered WordPress users and WooCommerce customers. It will help you improve your CRM workflow and experience.<\/p>\n<h4>Send Events<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with the ability to set up send events. These are triggers that will automatically send out a notification when something specific happens on your site. There are many available send events, including the WooCommerce features mentioned above as well site-specific triggers like when a profile is updated, a password is changed, a new post is published, a new comment is created, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You can assign any email that you have created in the plugin to each send event. You could even create multiple send events for the same trigger and assign multiple different notifications to them. The possibilities are endless!<\/p>\n<p>Available send actions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New user registration<\/li>\n<li>When a user profile is updated<\/li>\n<li>When a user role changes<\/li>\n<li>When a user password is reset<\/li>\n<li>After a specified amount of time that a user has not logged in<\/li>\n<li>When a new post is published<\/li>\n<li>When a there is a new comment<\/li>\n<li>A specified amount of time after a WooCommerce cart has been abandoned<\/li>\n<li>When a WooCommerce product is purchased<\/li>\n<li>A specified amount of time after a WooCommerce purchase<\/li>\n<li>When a new WooCommerce product is added<\/li>\n<li>When a WooCommerce subscription is purchased\/created<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Email Logging<\/h4>\n<p>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin also includes a powerful email logging tool. This logs not only the emails sent by the plugin itself, but all emails sent out from your WordPress. This is invaluable for knowing whether or not your messages are getting through and, if not, why. The details included in the log are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email status (e.g. success, failure, failure reason)<\/li>\n<li>Subject<\/li>\n<li>Recipient<\/li>\n<li>Send date<\/li>\n<li>Output of the email content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We have also included an option to <strong>send a notification to the admin whenever the log detects that an email has failed to send<\/strong>. You can customize this message with your own content and dynamic template tags that will automatically include pertinent information about the failed email.<\/p>\n<h4>SMTP<\/h4>\n<p>We have also included the ability for you to <strong>add in your own SMTP information for email sending<\/strong>. With this you can send emails from your real email address\/server\/host.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress users often find that automatic emails sent from their site fail to get to the recipient. This is usually because they are blocked or flagged as spam. If you have checked the logs and noticed the emails are being sent, but not received, then it&#8217;s usually a good idea to use the SMTP feature to send emails via your real address. This will greatly reduce the chance of them getting blocked.<\/p>\n<p>The following SMTP info can be entered\/customized:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SMTP host<\/li>\n<li>Encryption type<\/li>\n<li>Port number<\/li>\n<li>Email address authentication<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will also find options that let you <strong>specify the from name and address<\/strong> for your automatic emails.<\/p>\n<h4>Subscription Interests<\/h4>\n<p>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin also comes with the ability for you to let users choose different interests for which they can receive notification updates. This can be added to the user profile page and the user registration form. You can also added anywhere else on your site using the handy included <strong>Subscription Interests Gutenberg block<\/strong> or <strong>shortcode<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Here they can choose from the following interests:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce product categories<\/li>\n<li>Post categories<\/li>\n<li>Unique Ultimate WP Mail categories, which you can include in the plugin and utilize for custom emails<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a user has selected any subscription interest, they will automatically receive a notification when that event happens (new product or post is published, etc.).<\/p>\n<h4>Additional Features<\/h4>\n<p>Ultimate WP Mail comes with a number of other advanced email sending features that will help you make your email management and email sending as efficient and effective as possible. Additional features include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>User statistics that show the number of emails opened and links clicked<\/li>\n<li>Email categories, which can be used in combination with user lists to create well-targeted emails<\/li>\n<li>Option to automatically include an unsubscribe link in emails<\/li>\n<li>Styling options to further refine the look of your emails (email background color, email text alignment, email block styling)<\/li>\n<li>Labelling options, so you can change the text of elements like the subscribe and unsubscribe links as well as the subscription interests form <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The emails created in and by Ultimate WP Mail are all responsive emails.
