        "description": "<p>Gato GraphQL is a productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the GraphQL language.<\/p>\n<p>Use Gato GraphQL to create headless WordPress sites (using Nextjs or any other JS framework), power your Gutenberg blocks, fetch data for your theme, plugin or website, or expose an API for other applications.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports Persisted Queries out of the box. Persisted queries are similar to WP REST API endpoints, however they are created and published directly within the wp-admin, using the GraphQL language (and no PHP code at all).<\/p>\n<p>With persisted queries, you can have the great user experience of GraphQL, while having the security from a REST API, limiting clients and visitors to only query the data that you have defined in advance.<\/p>\n<p>You can also create public and private custom endpoints, exposing each of them for some specific target (whether different applications, clients, teams, or other), and have a private endpoint feed data to your custom Gutenberg blocks.<\/p>\n<h3>Architectural foundation<\/h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>optimized for speed:<\/strong> The query is resolved on linear time complexity, and does not suffer the &#8220;n+1&#8221; problem. The GraphQL schema is generated only the first time, and cached. The response can be cached, using standard HTTP Caching. And installing additional CPTs does not affect the speed of creating the schema.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is also <strong>fully extensible<\/strong>, so you can create your own extensions and integrations, to extend the GraphQL schema for your own CPTs and plugins.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>super configurable<\/strong>, to suit your specific needs, even endpoint by endpoint.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, Gato GraphQL is <strong>forward-looking<\/strong>, already providing features that have been proposed for the GraphQL spec but not yet released.<\/p>\n<h3>Features<\/h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL provides <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">all these features<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security:<\/strong> Multiple mechanisms are provided to help protect your data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Custom Endpoints:<\/strong> Create and expose multiple custom GraphQL schemas under their own URL, for different users, applications, external services, or other.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persisted Queries:<\/strong> GraphQL queries which are stored in the server and accessed under their own URL, thus emulating a REST endpoint.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Predefined Persisted Queries:<\/strong> Tackle admin tasks that are common to WordPress sites, by executing an already-installed persisted query.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Public, Private &amp;

Each endpoint has its own URL, and its data is pre-defined (for the corresponding resources, such as posts, users, etc).<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports &#8220;Persisted Queries&#8221;, which are also endpoints with pre-defined data, however these can be created and published directly within the wp-admin, using GraphQL language (and without any PHP code).<\/p>\n<p>With Gato GraphQL you can also execute tailored GraphQL queries against an endpoint, indicating what specific data you need, and fetching only that within a single request.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20gato%20graphql%20plugin%20and%20its%20pro%20version%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the difference between the Gato GraphQL plugin and its PRO version?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Gato GraphQL plugin maps the WordPress schema, and is enough to use GraphQL as an API, such as for building headless sites.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL PRO is needed for enhanced security for public APIs, adding HTTP caching, sending emails, executing updates in bulk, connecting to external services, and automating tasks (among others).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20gato%20graphql%20different%20than%20wpgraphql%3F'>\nHow is Gato GraphQL different than WPGraphQL?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you just need to build a headless WordPress site and deploy it as static, and you&#8217;re currently using WPGraphQL, switching to Gato GraphQL will not make any difference.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, switching to Gato GraphQL provides many benefits:<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;n+1&#8221; query problem just doesn&#8217;t happen, by design.<\/p>\n<p>When using persisted queries to expose predefined data, you can completely disable the GraphQL single endpoint, so that it is not accessible even to authenticated users.<\/p>\n<p>When caching the GraphQL response using standard HTTP caching, the <code>max-age<\/code> header is calculated automatically, from all the fields present in the GraphQL query (PRO).<\/p>\n<p>You can provide multiple custom endpoints, each of them customized to a specific customer or application, protecting them via a password. And you can add custom categories to them, and give them a hierarchy (such as <code>\/graphql\/customers\/some-customer<\/code> and <code>\/graphql\/customers\/another-customer<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>You can execute updates in bulk. For instance, you can delete all comments on the site, or assign a tag or category to all your posts. And you can search and replace a string, even using a regex, on hundreds of posts (PRO).<\/p>\n<p>You will have access to novel GraphQL features, proposed for the spec but not yet released, including nested mutations, schema namespacing and the &#8216;oneOf&#8217; Input Object. And also dynamic variables and Multiple Query Execution (PRO).<\/p>\n<p>You can validate that only logged-in users, or users with a certain role or capability, or visitors from a certain IP range, can access data, on a field-by-field basis (PRO).<\/p>\n<p>You can compose fields, so that a foundational set of field resolvers can cover an unlimited number of use cases, and compose directives, so that a directive can be applied on an inner property from the field&#8217;s value.<\/p>\n<p>You can expose private endpoints, accessible only within the wp-admin, to power your Gutenberg blocks. And you can access a private GraphQL server, to fetch data for your application using PHP code, without exposing any public-facing endpoint (PRO).<\/p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to retrieve, modify and finally store again the content in your site, all within a single GraphQL document (PRO). For instance, you can fetch all the Gutenberg blocks in a post, extract their properties, translate those strings via Google Translate API, insert those strings back into the block, and store the post again.<\/p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to import posts from another WordPress site, from an RSS feed, from a CSV, or from any REST or GraphQL API. And you can export content as JSON and CSV. (PRO)<\/p>\n<p>You can invoke the API of any external service via an HTTP client (PRO). For instance, you can subscribe your WordPress users to your Mailchimp email list.<\/p>\n<p>You can receive and process incoming data from any service via a dedicated webhook (PRO). For instance, you can capture the newsletter emails registered in an InstaWP sandbox site and send them automatically to Mailchimp.<\/p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to automate tasks and content workflows (PRO). For instance, when a new post is created (event via hook <code>draft_post<\/code>) you can execute a persisted query that checks if the post does not have a thumbnail and, in that case, generates one by calling the Stable Diffusion API, compresses the image via TinyPng, and finally inserts the image as the post&#8217;s featured image.<\/p>\n<p>And all of these additional uses cases can be achieved directly within the wp-admin, providing the GraphQL query via a user interface, without having to deploy any PHP code.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20gato%20graphql%20pro%20have%20a%20refund%20policy%3F'>\nDoes Gato GraphQL PRO have a refund policy?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does.

If you are able to learn this language, then you are able to use Gato GraphQL.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20want%20to%20use%20gato%20graphql%20to%20manage%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nWhy would I want to use Gato GraphQL to manage my WordPress site?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>GraphQL is a super powerful language`, that can achieve a lot more than just building headless sites, and it&#8217;s easy to learn.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is a generic tool that extracts all the power from GraphQL. You provide the GraphQL query directly via the wp-admin, and dozens of use cases (normally provided by dedicated plugins) become available.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is not a duplicator plugin, but you can duplicate posts with it. It is not a translation plugin, but you can translate any content, including the properties inside Gutenberg blocks. It is not an automator plugin, but you can automate your tasks, without any restriction. It is not a backup plugin, but you can import and export posts. It is not a search and replace plugin, but you can modify your posts in bulk, with a single query. And it is not webhook plugin or HTTP client, but you can both send a request to any API, and receive and process incoming requests from any service.<\/p>\n<p>What you can use Gato GraphQL for, literally depends on your imagination.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20predefined%20graphql%20queries%20for%20common%20use%20cases%3F'>\nAre there predefined GraphQL queries for common use cases?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">queries library<\/a> contains a collection of GraphQL queries for common use cases, which you can copy\/paste and customize to your needs.<\/p>\n<p>This library is continually growing.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20provide%20documentation%3F'>\nDoes the plugin provide documentation?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Gato GraphQL website contains extensive documentation, including <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/guides\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">guides<\/a> on configuring and using the plugin, the <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/extensions-reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">extensions reference<\/a> docs, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/tutorial\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tutorial<\/a> to learn all the elements of the GraphQL schema.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

    "description": "<p>Gato GraphQL is a productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the GraphQL language.<\/p>\n<p>Use Gato GraphQL to create headless WordPress sites (using Nextjs or any other JS framework), power your Gutenberg blocks, fetch data for your theme, plugin or website, or expose an API for other applications.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports Persisted Queries out of the box. Persisted queries are similar to WP REST API endpoints, however they are created and published directly within the wp-admin, using the GraphQL language (and no PHP code at all).<\/p>\n<p>With persisted queries, you can have the great user experience of GraphQL, while having the security from a REST API, limiting clients and visitors to only query the data that you have defined in advance.<\/p>\n<p>You can also create public and private custom endpoints, exposing each of them for some specific target (whether different applications, clients, teams, or other), and have a private endpoint feed data to your custom Gutenberg blocks.<\/p>\n<h3>Architectural foundation<\/h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>optimized for speed:<\/strong> The query is resolved on linear time complexity, and does not suffer the &#8220;n+1&#8221; problem. The GraphQL schema is generated only the first time, and cached. The response can be cached, using standard HTTP Caching. And installing additional CPTs does not affect the speed of creating the schema.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is also <strong>fully extensible<\/strong>, so you can create your own extensions and integrations, to extend the GraphQL schema for your own CPTs and plugins.<\/p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>super configurable<\/strong>, to suit your specific needs, even endpoint by endpoint.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, Gato GraphQL is <strong>forward-looking<\/strong>, already providing features that have been proposed for the GraphQL spec but not yet released.<\/p>\n<h3>Features<\/h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL provides <a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">all these features<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security:<\/strong> Multiple mechanisms are provided to help protect your data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Custom Endpoints:<\/strong> Create and expose multiple custom GraphQL schemas under their own URL, for different users, applications, external services, or other.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Persisted Queries:<\/strong> GraphQL queries which are stored in the server and accessed under their own URL, thus emulating a REST endpoint.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Predefined Persisted Queries:<\/strong> Tackle admin tasks that are common to WordPress sites, by executing an already-installed persisted query.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Public, Private &amp; Password-Protected Endpoints:<\/strong> In addition to creating and exposing public endpoints, create private endpoints, and protect a public endpoint with a password.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internal Endpoint for Blocks:<\/strong> Fetch data for your Gutenberg blocks, via an internal GraphQL endpoint accessible within the wp-admin only.<\/li>\n<li><strong>API Hierarchy:<\/strong> Organize endpoints hierarchically, to group and expose related endpoints under a logical structure.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Endpoint Management:<\/strong> Organize custom endpoint and persisted queries by assigning them custom categories, similar to posts in WordPress.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Schema namespacing:<\/strong> Avoid conflicts in the schema, by having all type names automatically namespaced.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Nested mutations:<\/strong> Execute a mutation within a queried entity (similar to accessing a field), and not only on the root type in the GraphQL query.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u201cSensitive\u201d data:<\/strong> Decide if to expose or not private data in a public API.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Global Fields:<\/strong> Common fields added to all types of the GraphQL schema (while being defined only once).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Composable directives:<\/strong> Expose directives that augment other directives, modifying their behavior or filling a gap.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Field Directives:<\/strong> Have directives applied to multiple fields (instead of only one), for performance and extended use cases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>&#8216;oneOf&#8217; Input Object:<\/strong> Input object where exactly one of the input fields must be provided as input, or the server returns a validation error.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Returning different types on mutations:<\/strong> Mutation fields can be configured to return either a payload object type, or directly the mutated entity.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Field and directive-based versioning:<\/strong> Version fields and directives independently from the overall schema.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proactive feedback:<\/strong> Use the top-level entry &#8216;extensions&#8217; to send data concerning deprecations and warnings in the response to the query.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Go PRO<\/h3>\n<p>Unleash your capabilities with <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gatographql.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gato GraphQL PRO<\/a><\/strong>, which contains all our PRO extensions for Gato GraphQL.<\/p>\n<p>Use Gato GraphQL PRO to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expose public and private APIs<\/li>\n<li>Complement WP-CLI to execute admin tasks<\/li>\n<li>Update posts in bulk<\/li>\n<li>Search\/replace content for site migrations<\/li>\n<li>Send an email\/notifications when something happens (new post published, new comment added, etc)<\/li>\n<li>Synchronize content across sites, or a multisite network<\/li>\n<li>Insert or remove Gutenberg blocks in bulk<\/li>\n<li>Automatically insert a mandatory block when creating a new post<\/li>\n<li>Translate content in the site using the Google Translate API<\/li>\n<li>Automatically translate new posts to all different languages in a multisite<\/li>\n<li>Generate an image using OpenAI&#8217;s DALL-E or Stable Diffusion, and set it as featured image<\/li>\n<li>Send new posts to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, or other social media platforms<\/li>\n<li>Import a post from another WordPress site<\/li>\n<li>Import all posts from a JSON or CSV file (including from Google Sheets)<\/li>\n<li>Export all posts to a JSON or CSV file<\/li>\n<li>Import a post from an RSS feed<\/li>\n<li>Create posts from static html files<\/li>\n<li>Interact with cloud services via an HTTP client<\/li>\n<li>Convert the data from a 3rd-party API into the required format<\/li>\n<li>Call external APIs to validate your data<\/li>\n<li>Automate tasks and content workflows when some event happens (eg: <code>wp_insert_post<\/code>), like Zapier for WordPress<\/li>\n<li>Use WP-Cron to regularly execute GraphQL queries<\/li>\n<li>And much more&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Gato GraphQL PRO can help you simplify your tech stack, handling the functionality from multiple plugins (so you need to install fewer plugins in your site, and remove bloat), including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2705 APIs<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Automator<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Bulk editing\/Post duplicator<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Code snippets<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Content distribution<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Email notifications<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 HTTP client<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Import\/export<\/li>\n<li>\u2705 Search &amp;
