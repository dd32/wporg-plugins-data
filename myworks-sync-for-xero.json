Your server should run on Linux and have at least PHP 7.4. You also need an active trial or paid plan with MyWorks at <a href=\"https:\/\/myworks.software\/pricing\/#woocommerce+xero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/myworks.software\/pricing\/#woocommerce+xero<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20xero%20countries%2Fversions%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhat Xero countries\/versions do you support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>MyWorks Sync supports all versions\/countries of Xero, including any tax and currency for your locale.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20quickbooks%20online%3F'>\nDo you support QuickBooks Online?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We do support syncing with QuickBooks, with the same robust features included in our Xero Sync. You can view our sync with QuickBooks here.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/myworks.software\/integrations\/woocommerce-quickbooks-sync\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/myworks.software\/integrations\/woocommerce-quickbooks-sync\/<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nDo you have a free trial?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Even better! We have a completely free Launch plan you can use to get up and syncing right away. As your order volume \/ functionality needs grow, you can change to our paid plans at any time.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20sync%20work%3F%20%20will%20old%20data%20be%20automatically%20synced%3F'>\nHow does the sync work?  Will old data be automatically synced?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As soon as you finish setting up our sync, we&#8217;ll only start automatically syncing NEW data. This automatic sync can be enabled\/disabled individually for different data types, like customers, orders, products, inventory and more &#8211; so you can control which new data you&#8217;d like to automatically sync. OLD (historic) data will NOT be automatically synced &#8211; but it&#8217;s easy as pie to push over, using our Push section!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20support%20work%3F'>\nHow does support work?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>All plans include 24\/7 support ticket assistance with our amazing US\/UK support team! Paid plans include a complimentary 30 minute setup call\/screenshare, and our Scale plan includes 12\/5 phone support.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20sync%20data%20both%20ways%20between%20xero%20and%20woocommerce%3F'>\nCan I sync data both ways between Xero and WooCommerce?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Our sync  gives you the ability to automatically sync products &amp; inventory (paid plans only) both directions between WooCommerce and Xero  &#8211; automatically and manually (pushing historic data).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20push%20existing%2Fold%20customers%2C%20orders%20%26%20products%20into%20xero%3F'>\nCan I push existing\/old customers, orders &amp; products into Xero?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Heck ya! You can use our Push section to push your existing customers, products, orders and more into Xero &#8211; and even pull products into WooCommerce from Xero! (Our monthly plans have a limit of pushing up to the last 30 days of orders, and the forever free Launch plan has a limit of up to the last 7 days of orders.)<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20orders%20be%20synced%20as%20soon%20as%20they%27re%20placed%3F'>\nWill orders be synced as soon as they&#8217;re placed?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>They sure will! Why wait all day? Our sync is in real-time \u2013 so new customers, products, orders and more will be automatically synced right away! (Inventory level sync happens every 5 minutes.) You can control at which WooCommerce Status that orders are synced.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20sync%20multiple%20stores%20to%20one%20xero%20company%3F'>\nCan I sync multiple stores to one Xero company?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can sync as many WooCommerce stores as you\u2019d like to the same Xero account. You will just need a paid plan for each store.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20have%20some%20data%20already%20entered%20into%20xero%2C%20will%20it%20be%20duplicated%3F'>\nIf I have some data already entered into Xero, will it be duplicated?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our sync never duplicates customers, orders or products! If we&#8217;ve already synced an order into Xero, you can update\/push it in WooCommerce, and we&#8217;ll simply update it in Xero. If you have orders in Xero entered manually or by another integration &#8211; that&#8217;s not a problem. Our sync may not recognize them if they don&#8217;t match your WooCommerce order number, but we won&#8217;t attempt to automatically re-sync them.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20more%20faq%20or%20docs%3F'>\nAre there any more FAQ or Docs?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There sure are! Visit our growing docs site at <a href=\"https:\/\/support.myworks.software\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/support.myworks.software<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20easy%20is%20the%20setup%3F%20will%20i%20be%20able%20to%20get%20help%20if%20i%20need%20it%3F'>\nHow easy is the setup? Will I be able to get help if I need it?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost too easy! All you&#8217;ll have to do is connect to Xero and map any existing data together &#8211; that&#8217;s it! We have easy to follow documentation, a setup wizard and even a setup video tutorial &#8211; all to make your setup as seamless as possible! You&#8217;ll always have 24\/7 support ticket access in your account with us, and our sales team has been known to assist with setup questions over our 12\/5 live chat as well \ud83d\ude42 Our paid plans even include a complimentary setup call\/screenshare so we can help answer any questions and make sure you&#8217;re up and running correctly!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20should%20my%20products%20be%20as%20i%20start%20getting%20set%20up%20with%20myworks%3F'>\nWhere should my products be as I start getting set up with MyWorks?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: We recommend you at least start with all your products in WooCommerce, and each should have a unique SKU (although not required, it&#8217;s helpful to you going forward). If all of your products are in Xero, that\u2019s fine too \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to pull them into WooCommerce through our sync. Or &#8211; you can start out with a perfectly clean slate, and optionally have us automatically sync new products as you create them.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20compatible%20with%20variations%2C%20groups%2C%20bundled%20products%20%26%20composite%20products%3F'>\nAre you compatible with variations, groups, bundled products &amp; composite products?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: We sure are! Although Bundled &amp; Composite products are not native to WooCommerce (added by a plugin), we still have built-in compatibility with them, so you&#8217;re all covered!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20woocommerce%20extensions%2Fplugins%20you%27re%20already%20compatible%20with%3F'>\nAre there any WooCommerce extensions\/plugins you&#8217;re already compatible with?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: There sure are! We support over 25+ popular WooCommerce extensions &#8211; all included in our paid plans! A few examples of our built-in compatibility are Sequential Order Numbers Pro, Cost of Goods Sold, Avalara, Taxify, WooCommerce Subscriptions and Product Bundles.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
