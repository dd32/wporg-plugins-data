This means that you can&#8217;t display the feed from your own personal Facebook profile. This is to do with Facebook&#8217;s privacy policies. You can&#8217;t display a non-public Facebook feed publicly.<\/p>\n<p>If your Facebook page has any restrictions on it (age, for example) then it means that people have to be signed into Facebook in order to view your page. This isn&#8217;t desirable for most Facebook pages as it means that it isn&#8217;t accessible by people who don&#8217;t have a Facebook account and that your Facebook page can&#8217;t be crawled and indexed by search engines.<\/p>\n<p>An easy way to determine whether your Facebook page is set to public is to sign out of your Facebook account and try to visit your page. If Facebook forces you to sign in to view your page then it isn&#8217;t public. You can change your Facebook page to public in your Facebook page settings simply by removing any age or location restrictions you have on it (<a href=\"https:\/\/smashballoon.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/facebook-page-restrictions.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">screenshot<\/a>), which will then allow the Custom Facebook Feed plugin to access and display your feed.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20feeds%20from%20multiple%20facebook%20pages%3F'>\nCan I display feeds from multiple Facebook pages?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep!

Just click &#8220;Add New&#8221; to create a new feed and then embed it anywhere on your site.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20feeds%20from%20a%20facebook%20group%3F'>\nCan I display feeds from a Facebook Group?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of April of 2024 the plugin is no longer able to display posts from a Facebook group. This is due to changes on Facebook&#8217;s end.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20the%20feed%20from%20a%20personal%20facebook%20profile%3F'>\nCan I display the feed from a personal Facebook profile?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy you&#8217;re not able to use the plugin to display all of your posts from a personal profile, only from a public page, as posts from a personal profile are protected for privacy reasons. You may have limited success in displaying certain posts from a personal profile but most posts are not able to be displayed.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the profile to represent a business, organization, product, public figure or the like, then we&#8217;d advise converting your profile to a page per <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/175644189234902\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook&#8217;s recommendation<\/a>, as there are many advantages to using pages over profiles.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done so, the plugin will be able to retrieve and display all of your posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20facebook%20oembeds%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with Facebook oEmbeds?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In version 2.5, support was added to allow the plugin to power your Facebook oEmbeds as official support for these is no longer available in WordPress core. Just connect your account on the oEmbeds settings page inside the plugin and the plugin will power all Facebook embeds on your site, old and new. No developer app or account required.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20photos%20and%20videos%20in%20my%20custom%20facebook%20feed%3F'>\nCan I show photos and videos in my Custom Facebook feed?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This free plugin only allows you to display text from your Facebook posts.

We&#8217;ve completely redesigned the plugin settings from head to toe to make it easier to create, manage, and customize your Facebook feeds.<\/li>\n<li>New: All your feeds are now displayed in one place on the &#8220;All Feeds&#8221; page. This shows a list of any existing (legacy) feeds and any new ones that you create. Note: If you updated from a version prior to v2.19 then you may need to view your feeds on your webpage so that the plugin can locate them and list them here.<\/li>\n<li>New: Easily edit individual feed settings for new feeds instead of cumbersome shortcode options.<\/li>\n<li>New: It&#8217;s now much easier to create feeds. Just click &#8220;Add New&#8221;, select your feed type, connect your account, and you&#8217;re done!<\/li>\n<li>New: Brand new feed customizer.

This will help minimize any affects of a Facebook API change on May 25th which will only allow Facebook Groups to retrieve content from the past 90 days. The plugin will store your group posts in the persistent cache so that those posts can continue to be displayed beyond 90 days. This update will also make a one-time request to get the last 100 posts from your group and store those too, so that the affect of this change will be minimal for our users. Please <a href=\"https:\/\/smashballoon.com\/doc\/facebook-api-change-limits-groups-to-90-days\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see here<\/a> for more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Updated jQuery methods in preparation for jQuery migrate removal in an upcoming WordPress core update.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Added option to enqueue CSS and JS files only when shortcode is on the page.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Added an reset error log button to the settings page.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Added an option to hide the call-to-action button in the post content.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Changed how access tokens are retrieved to prevent conflict with the &#8220;Rank Math SEO&#8221; plugin when connecting an account.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an error in the Feed Finder tool when removing accounts.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with duplicated records in the feed finder.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed &#8220;Unknown error&#8221; response with API story tag calls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.19<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Improved the error reporting system to make resolving issues easier.<\/li>\n<li>New: The locations of the Facebook feeds on your site will now be logged and listed on a single page for easier management. After this feature has been active for awhile, a &#8220;Feed Finder&#8221; link will appear under your connected accounts on the plugin Settings page which allows you to see a list of all feeds on your site along with their locations.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: When clearing the plugin cache, the cache in the Litespeed plugin will now also be cleared if being used on the site.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with anonymous avatars not displaying correctly in group feeds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.18.3<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak: Updated deprecated jQuery functions to prevent potential issues with newer versions.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Due to an API bug which Facebook hasn&#8217;t resolved yet that affects buy\/sell posts in groups, we have added a &#8216;salesposts&#8217; shortcode option which will work around the issue until they fix it. If you are displaying posts from a group and receiving an &#8220;API Error 100&#8221; notice then adding <code>salesposts=true<\/code> to your shortcode and clearing the plugin cache should resolve the issue.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: When displaying the feed in multiple columns, clicking the &#8220;See more&#8221; link in the post text wouldn&#8217;t correctly reconfigure the layout.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a layout issue with the posts and Like Box which occurred when using a multi-column layout and applying feed padding.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with the background color not being applied correctly when set to be black.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.18.2<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak: Now displays a notice to logged-in admins which lets you know if the Like Box or header cover photo is being intentionally hidden due to the GDPR setting.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an error which occurred when deleting the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.18.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with the integration with the Complianz plugin<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved a PHP warning related to the preg_replace_callback function which was displayed under certain conditions<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Resolved a PHP deprecation notice related to the strpos function in PHP 7.3<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.18<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: The plugin code has been completely refactored to improve performance and maintainability. If you experience any issues with this update then please open a support ticket <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/custom-facebook-feed\/\" rel=\"ugc\">here<\/a> so that we can address it right away. Thank you!<\/li>\n<li>New: Integrations with popular GDPR cookie consent solutions added: Cookie Notice by dFactory, GDPR Cookie Consent by WebToffee, Cookiebot by Cybot A\/S, Complianz by Really Simple Plugins, and Borlabs Cookie by Borlabs. See the GDPR setting in the following location for more information: Facebook Feed &gt; Customize &gt; Misc &gt; GDPR.<\/li>\n<li>Note: The minimum supported PHP version has been increased to PHP version 5.6. If you are using a lower version then a notice will be displayed with a button to revert back to the previous version.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.17.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak: Added shortcode options for the &#8220;Before Date&#8221; and &#8220;After Date&#8221; settings, so that a custom text string can be displayed before and after the Facebook post date.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Minor frontend CSS improvements.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Added support for improved notices on the plugin settings page.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue with the Facebook Like Box widget displaying an error if the width was set to a fractional pixel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.17<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Added support for Facebook oEmbeds. When you share a link to a Facebook post or video, WordPress automatically converts it into an embedded Facebook post for you (an &#8220;oEmbed&#8221;). However, on October 24, 2020, WordPress is discontinuing support for Facebook oEmbeds and so any existing or new embeds will no longer work. Don&#8217;t worry though, we have your back! This update adds support for Facebook oEmbeds and so, after updating, the Custom Facebook Feed plugin will automatically keep your oEmbeds working. It will also power any new oEmbeds you post going forward.<\/li>\n<li>New: Install our other free social media plugins right from the Custom Facebook Feed settings menu. Use our Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter plugins to add even more social content to your website and help further engage your viewers and increase your followers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.16.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Added a workaround for a Facebook API bug which sometimes displays a button in a post with the text &#8220;No Button&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Added an additional check when formatting the post text for the share link to prevent potential issues.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a typo in the &#8220;restrictedpage&#8221; shortcode option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.16<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Important: Due to upcoming Facebook API changes on September 4, 2020, it will only be possible to display feeds from Facebook pages which you are an admin of. If a PPCA Error notice is displayed above your feed then this change will affect one or more of your feeds. For more information about this change, please <a href=\"https:\/\/smashballoon.com\/facebook-api-changes-september-4-2020\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak: Added the &#8220;pagetype&#8221; setting to the shortcode when clicking the &#8220;Add to another feed&#8221; button on the Settings page to ensure it&#8217;s set correctly<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a minor compatibility issue with the upcoming WordPress 5.5 release<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Removed the see more\/less links from post text when using the email share link.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Removed a stray &#8220;section&#8221; closing tag which was causing a layout issue in some themes and inadvertently displayed the PPCA notice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.15.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The opt-in notice to help improve the plugin was not dismissing as expected for some sites due to the admin JavaScript file being cached by the browser.<\/li>\n<li>Fix: Disabled the &#8220;About Us&#8221; page plugin installation if using a version of WordPress earlier than 4.6.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2.15<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Added a new visual header option which displays the cover photo, avatar, page name, bio, and number of likes from your Facebook page at the top of your feeds. To enable the header, go to Facebook Feed &gt; Customize &gt; General &gt; Header &gt; Header Type &gt; Visual.<\/li>\n<li>New: To help us improve the plugin we&#8217;ve added the ability to opt-in to usage tracking so that we can understand what features and settings are being used, and which features matter to you the most. This is disabled by default and will only be enabled if you explictly choose to opt in. If opted in, the plugin will send a report in the background once per week with your plugin settings and basic information about your website environment. No personal or sensitive data is collected (such as email addresses, Instagram account information, license keys, etc). To enable or disable usage tracking at a later date use the setting at: Instagram Feed &gt; Customize &gt; Advanced &gt; Misc &gt; Enable Usage Tracking. See <a href=\"https:\/\/smashballoon.com\/custom-facebook-feed\/docs\/usage-tracking\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a> for more information.<\/li>\n<li>New: Added a setting to display a different number of posts on mobile devices vs desktop. While on the configure tab, check the box &#8220;Show different number for mobile&#8221; to reveal the setting.<\/li>\n<li>New: Added capability &#8220;manage_custom_facebook_feed_options&#8221;.

If there&#8217;s an issue with a Facebook feed on your website which hasn&#8217;t been resolved yet then you&#8217;ll receive an email notification to let you know. This is sent once per week until the issue is resolved. These emails can be disabled by using the following setting: Facebook Feed &gt; Customize &gt; Misc &gt; Feed Issue Email Report.<\/li>\n<li>New: Admin notifications for critical Facebook feed issues. If there is an error with a Facebook feed, admins will see notices in the dashboard and on the front-end of the site along with instructions on how to resolve the issue. Front-end admin notifications can be disabled by using the following setting: Facebook Feed &gt; Customize &gt; Misc &gt; Disable Admin Error Notice.<\/li>\n<li>New: Added a WordPress &#8216;Site Health&#8217; integration. If there is a critical error with your feeds, it will now be flagged in the site health page.<\/li>\n<li>New: Added &#8220;About Us&#8221; page for those who would like to learn more about Smash Balloon and our other products.

This plugin is an absolute failure from top to bottom and should be shut down until they can produce a working product!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not an easy experience.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zeropur\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6070925108673b675b84355e86576393?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6070925108673b675b84355e86576393?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/zeropur\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\"> <small>(zeropur)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 14, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">So we purchased the pro version for Facebook as I run a group page.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">The sole reason was to show our events from FB on our website.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Man, I had not realise this was going to be such a pain.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">First the plugin didn't work.
