To do an automatic install of Payment Page, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8220;Add New&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Payment Page&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you\u2019ll be redirected to the Quick Setup Process to begin connecting your payment gateway and importing templates.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application.

Then, you can select a Payment Page template based on your business needs. Customize the template as you choose, and you&#8217;ll be accepting payments in minutes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20best%20wordpress%20payment%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat is the best WordPress payment plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many plugins available to receive payments on your WordPress site. We built Payment Page to be as simple as possible to set up and accept payments as quickly as possible. It only takes 60 seconds to start accepting payments with Payment Page if you already have a Stripe account set up. For PayPal, only 2-3 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The speed is optimized by our Quick Setup process, which puts you right in the driver&#8217;s seat to select your Template and connect your payment gateway in seconds. Templates are easily customized after import.<\/p>\n<p>We streamlined the entire process of creating flexible payment options for your customers with different currencies, payment frequencies, and intelligent filters that only display the relevant plans for customers to select.<\/p>\n<p>We prioritized having a wide variety of payment options because many other solutions only support one gateway and a limited number of options. Flexibility is key in a world where we have so many digital wallets, customers potentially around the world, and consumer preferences demand streamlined payment flows.<\/p>\n<p>Because of some of these core tools, we believe Payment Page stands apart from the crowd.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20payment%20gateways%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat Payment Gateways are supported?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Stripe and PayPal are currently both supported.

This allows the customer to enter the amount they want to pay on the frontend of the form.<\/p>\n<p>Read about Custom Payment Amounts in our <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.payment.page\/pricing-options\/custom-payment-amounts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20custom%20form%20fields%20supported%3F'>\nAre custom form fields supported?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely.

Elementor is a lightweight page builder that doesn\u2019t dominate your website, and it can simply be installed in the background in order to use Payment Page on a single Elementor-based page.<\/p>\n<p>We recognize that Elementor isn\u2019t the only player, so we are planning support for Gutenberg Blocks, Divi, and potentially other major builders. <a href=\"https:\/\/payment.page\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact us<\/a> or vote on our <a href=\"https:\/\/roadmap.payment.page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Roadmap<\/a>, as it will make a big impact as to what is prioritized in our development pipeline.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20confirmation%20emails%20when%20a%20payment%20is%20received%3F'>\nCan I send confirmation emails when a payment is received?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The email confirmation functionality is in BETA, so please reach out to us if you would like enabled.
