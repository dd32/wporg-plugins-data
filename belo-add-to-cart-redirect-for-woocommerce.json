        "description": "<p>The BELO Add to Cart Redirect for Woocommerce plugin is a special tool used to redirect customers to desired locations on the site such as the checkout page after a product is added to the cart to boost conversion and sales. Other common use cases include redirecting customers to the terms and conditions or end-user license agreement pages.<\/p>\n<p>Currently the plugin includes the following add to cart redirect modules:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global redirect:<\/strong> This sets a redirect for all products on the site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Simple product redirect:<\/strong> This sets a redirect location for only simple products.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parent variation product redirect:<\/strong> This sets a redirect location for all variation child products on the site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parent variation redirect:<\/strong> This sets a redirect location for individual varation products on the site.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Grouped product redirect:<\/strong> This sets a redirect location for only grouped products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

Most common use cases include redirecting to the checkout page after add to cart for all products.<\/li>\n<li>If the global redirect is disabled, the individual product redirect configurations will be used. For variation products, the parent redirect can be configured as well as the child redirects. If you want to redirect all child variations to the same location, you can simply just set the parent variation redirect. By default all child variations redirect to the parent variation redirect. However, redirect can be changed and configured to any desired location for each of the child variations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Support for translation<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using wpml for translation, support is included in the BELO Add to Cart Redirect for Woocommerce for the global setting. This implies that you only have to set the redirect in the admin default editing language. The translation of this redirect is automatically picked up and used for the different languages on your site. The redirect in the product edit pages needs to be set for each language.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
