They claim to have excellent support. I have been looking for a few hours now and what I've found was unanswered help inquiries from 3 years ago, and a recent one from 3 months ago where they don't appear to even pay attention to what the person is asking for. 'Please tell me what to do\" usually means the person needs a step for step of what to do or at least a general idea, not a nonsensical explanation of how something in it should work. I myself can't get the system to work, so I've been looking for answers and found zip.  Why would I waste my time contacting them after seeing their lack of understanding nor care?\n\n2. The system won't work for me. I keep getting a timeout error, or to input a valid shipping profile. I was able to input what the system decided was a valid shipping profile, but to do that I had to choose options that are not valid according to my ebay store. I do not like being forced to create a new shipping profile - and thus making a mess of my ebay settings with clutter - with options I do not want. Unlike other plugins it wouldn't capture my profiles I already have in place and just use those. So when it came time for me to be forced to create an entirely new returns policy, I said enough was enough and stopped. I don't take returns. The kind of items I sell encourage theft, because the people can copy the item and then claim a return. So I don't take them. I dislike being forced to say I do.\n\nTo go full on with this, the cost is something like $200. Why in the h*** would I pay that much after seeing the lack of care and attention their sample presents? Thank you no. Using this plugin I'd have to input everything myself anyway. Not wasting my time any further.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Really helpful!!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joshua96\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/53c10842a98754c2992415e74d36a59e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/53c10842a98754c2992415e74d36a59e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/joshua96\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">joshua96<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 6, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is a really useful plugin to make sure your inventory is synced across WooCommerce and my eBay store.

Both have extremely poor UI\/UX for premium Wordpress plugins but hey, there are only a handful of places that make these integrations and I was willing to look past this.\n\nHaving not really done 100% of my due diligence (but knowing most of what I needed from such a plugin and having bought similar plugins for eBay - not Etsy though) I went ahead got the two. Installed them (easy) and had a pretty good experience with their support and purchasing process.\n\nOnce I used the Etsy plugin though the problems started: No Prefix\/suffixing support (such as that in WP Lister for eBay). Per-product overrides (such as those from PlatyCorp Etsy aren't there. A shortcode-enabled description editor also isn't present. These are fairly standard fair for the field, and with no trial (only a chance to have a product demo - which I have no time or inclination for as someone who has very little extra time outside of running my business).\n\nWas left with a bitter taste at this and - after emails back and forth and no resolution in terms of a refund (despite repeated asking and despite this being only 2 days into my licence) I took to their Skype support  at the advice of their agent. \n\nNever seen a premium plugin company using freeware like Skype for live support and it felt pretty unprofessional frankly, but there you go. I got some help with fixing some misconceptions I had about the Etsy plugin, and I got authorization to edit their code (just swap a couple of variables) so that I could at least display the short description properly at the top of my Etsy descriptions (see what I said above about no shortcode editor).\n\nThe eBay plugin was another story. A complete mess and a marketplace as complicated as eBay needs a solid plugin to work with. Take my advice: Don't buy either of these plugins but particularly don't buy the eBay one - WP Lister is much better and worth the extra cash.\n\nAnd finally: Don't buy from these cowboys anyway. They have no real refund policy, their support - whilst attentive - is straight out of 2009, just like their plugin interfaces. I dropped $300 on this lot so that you don't have to.\n\nAnticipate a response along the lines of \"you didn't ask\/query about what features you wanted from these plugins\" - this is true, but if you're buy as a small business owner and expect at least a short cool-off period as offered by most other plugin providers you'll quickly realise these guys aren't out there to make their customers happy, they're just out for hard cash. It's not the way to do sustainable business, so hopefully you think twice before taking a gamble.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Funktioniert nicht gut.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wpaggassi\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/186e79ec27e7406b807b75ab68458c49?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/186e79ec27e7406b807b75ab68458c49?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wpaggassi\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">wpaggassi<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 29, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Siehe Bewertung von adamcarteruk.

This is going to be a dream!\"\n\nHow wrong was I.\n\nBE WARNED - THIS IS NOT AN OUT-OF-THE-BOX PRODUCT\n\nTo cut an incredibly long story short:\n\nThere were\/are many problems with the pro plugin which require ongoing work (and I mean whilst you're using it). I found so many problems with it that I had to keep requesting support from the CedCommerce team, sometimes waiting days for a response.\n\nIn the end, I decided that the plugin wasn't suitable for a business as was advertised.\n\nWho has the time to be messing around waiting for programmers to work on a plugin that should already be working? The plugin should work straight out-of-the-box like others do and that was what I was led to believe, and what you reading this is being led to believe.\n\nI had no idea, and was not warned, that I would be waiting on programmers to complete work on the plugin whilst I was using it, or trying to use it. That\u2019s not acceptable and because the plugin did not suit business needs, nor was it working correctly, I rightly requested a refund which I was told I could have. And that's where the real games began.\n\nFollowing on from being told I could have a refund by the Team Leader, I was deliberately cut off by their support team on live chat with her telling me I could NOT have a refund, then I was told I could NOT have a refund by another staff member. The Team Leader meanwhile went AWOL, though he was and still is there.\n\nAnd to this day, they are still saying they shouldn't provide me a refund. In the UK, this would never happen.\n\nI requested a refund through PayPal, but PayPal cancelled it because CedCommerce told them they did not offer me a refund even though they did and they know they did. I have the proof.\n\nAnd then just a day or two ago they emailed me saying they cannot refund me because PayPal cancelled my request... What? So PayPal controls CedCommerce now? No, I didn't think so. They are pulling out every trick in the book to avoid refunding me.\n\nIt is an absolute disgrace.\nLying to me and others such as PayPal is something I do not appreciate.\n\nCedCommerce have had ample time and opportunity to refund me, but are yet to do the right thing.\n\nNow I don't post negative reviews that often as it's not a nice thing to do, but with this purchase I had to. And I know CedCommerce will most likely reply to this review and sprout a load of lies and say \"...but we've been fabulous and we will work with you to fix your problems...\" - No, I don't want that. I haven't got time for that, which is why I've bought the eBay Product Lister I originally looked at in the first place.\n\nSo, some advice - do NOT download the CedCommerce Ebay Product Lister, and do NOT purchase the Pro version...PLEASE, DON'T DO IT! YOU WILL REGRET IT!\n\nCedCommerce's EBay Product Lister is simply a poor imitation of others; don't allow the allure of free support to cloud your judgement either.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Working Perfectly<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andre4891\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b55517f55ee918dc5f6fb401e160b5f8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b55517f55ee918dc5f6fb401e160b5f8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/andre4891\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">andre4891<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 25, 2017<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Amazing Extension.Installed Correctly and Support has been responsive to my Queries.
