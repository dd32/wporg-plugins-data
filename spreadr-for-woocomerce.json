WP need to take  serious look at this because if plugin authors are going to run background code to grab details without permission is a very serious issue.

Installing the app and setting up is very easy to do. But that's all. \n\nFirst off it is free only for 7 days, that should be listed somewhere that it is not a free plugin or it shouldn't be listed on the .org. After seeing that it's not free still decided to test it out. \n\nSecondly it is simple enough to import a product ... just find a product, copy the link, paste it and it is better than some others that it pulls in info, adds the price and has a button. So 1 star for that ... at least was able to import one product.\n\nOn the second day of trying to import products every link has an error message \"Product could not be added. Please check if it is valid Amazon product page.\" That's every single product tested. \n\nSeems they don't respond to the support forum for the app on Wordpress. So won't waste time there.\n\nI think the worst for this is that on other platforms their plug works and they offer support. To bad they don't do the same here. Hopefully at some point they will either realize that there is a support forum here or the plugin will be removed. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">It doesn&#039;t work.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ponml\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6fc13268d88d04d9f51da0643edd081?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6fc13268d88d04d9f51da0643edd081?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ponml\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ponml<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 29, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I'm so angry that I only paid money and couldn't get the service.\nAmong them, the most annoying thing is that spreadr continues to neglect the problem without solving it.\nIf I raise an issue, spreadr doesn't help me forward.\nThis is the worst plugin ever.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not working<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tanmoykumarshapu\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/fadb24bae0466b90795a70e36982c8b2?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/fadb24bae0466b90795a70e36982c8b2?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tanmoykumarshapu\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Tanmoy <small>(tanmoykumarshapu)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 8, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Not working...<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">BS!!!
