For the first time, we have made this technology accessible to the public in a WordPress plugin.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/eventagent.ai\/demo-home\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View our demo<\/a><\/p>\n<p>EventAgent.ai is the next-gen online-native platform for retreats, concerts, courses and drop-in events. It combines deep integration with Zoom meetings and AI-driven marketing. We get your events noticed and seats filled, then give you a comprehensive platform to manage them, empowering registrars, event managers, teachers, performers and promoters.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to learn how E.ai can make your Zoom and in-person events grow and thrive is to start with our case studies for your application.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workshops, retreats, livestreamed concerts and festivals<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You host single or multi-day events.  They can be small, with just a few people and presenters, or spanning multiple venues, speakers and weeks.  You hold your events mostly online for now, but plan to transition back to in-person centers.  You promote your events on social media. Online, you need to cater to people from different time zones, cultures and languages.  You struggle with Zoom to make it all work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventagent.ai\/home\/retreats-and-workshops\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See how E.ai can help you<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Courses, certificate programs and seminars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You host online courses.  They may be part of a larger curriculum for a certificate program.  For now, you&#8217;re running these online.  You need documented proof that program requirements have been met.  You might have many teachers and classes going on at once. You promote your events on social media. Online, you need to cater to people from different time zones, cultures and languages.  You struggle with Zoom to make it all work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventagent.ai\/home\/course-classroom-teaching\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See how E.ai can help you<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Drop-in classes, meetups and community<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you might offer workshops from time to time, your bread and butter is ongoing drop-in classes.  You might have a yoga studio or fitness center.  You might facilitate a support or recovery group.  You might be tired of paying meetup.com for something you can get for free. People drop in and pay a day fee, or members receive a package of free drop-in benefits. You promote your events on social media. Online, you need to cater to people from different time zones, cultures and languages.  You struggle with Zoom to make it all work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventagent.ai\/home\/drop-in-class-meetups-regular-meetings\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See how E.ai can help you<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll find E.ai is like no other event management system on the WordPress platform.  You can install it worry-free.  It&#8217;s completely free and requires no credit card. <strong>All features are available at all price levels, including free forever.<\/strong>  All of the use cases above are fully supported at the free price level. You won&#8217;t see that commitment from any other plugin.<\/p>\n",

Our event managers have praised the intuitive nature of the back-end, allowing simple access to student information and ease of communicating with them both before and after the event. Students appreciate receiving timely event reminders (which we can customize with additional info on making donations, links to the speaker's website, etc.) And with the one-time use Zoom links, we all have peace of mind knowing the event is secure from Zoom-bombing.\n\nE.ai also integrates seamlessly with our marketing vehicles, automatically promoting events that are undersubscribed or nearing the end of the registration period. This efficiency has saved us money in staff time, as prior to using E.ai this was all done manually.\n\nHaving worked with E.ai developer Alden for over ten years in different capacities, we're confident in his skill and commitment to this product over the long-term. I'd heartily recommend it to any organization looking to streamline all of the disparate aspects of planning and executing top-notch events!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Incredible customer service<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/adairlf\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a73c7e2737ead176ccbbcba1ea7a02c?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a73c7e2737ead176ccbbcba1ea7a02c?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/adairlf\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">adairlf<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 5, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">As I was learning to set up this plugin, I got incredible support from Alden.

THE most positive thing I can report is how easy it was to work with the plugin founder. He responded within hours almost 24\/7, and demonstrated extreme patience with me as well as responsiveness to my needs. ANd because I still get his periodic email updates, I know he has made continuous updates to the plugin. \nFor example, he recently made a major improvement to the email setup, which had really defeated me when I first started using it. So 5 stars for a unique, affordable event plugin with amazing customer service.  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Smooth experience, top notch support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cccnate\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a4283c1b23befb78a4a465c47c3e0ff6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a4283c1b23befb78a4a465c47c3e0ff6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cccnate\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">3C&#039;s <small>(cccnate)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 22, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">EventAgent.ai provides such a smooth user experience, and handles all Zoom logistics for you.

We had 9 Zoom sessions happening at the SAME time in some places, and over 80 sessions throughout the event, which had about 200 people live. I was so worried it would be a mess of folks needing links, I missed the link, where's my link?
