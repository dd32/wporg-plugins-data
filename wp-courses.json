If you can create a WordPress page or post, you can create a course. WP Courses leverages many familiar WordPress interfaces which makes creating courses feel familiar.<\/p>\n<h3>Create Any Type of Lesson for your Courses<\/h3>\n<p>Video lessons are supported with videos hosted on <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vimeo<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YouTube<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vdocipher.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">VdoCipher<\/a> and other platforms. You can also create lessons with text, audio, images and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Organize Your Lessons into Modules<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll probably want to organize your lessons into modules for your courses. WP Courses keeps this process incredibly simple. Choose the appropriate course, Click &#8220;add new module&#8221; and drag it where you want. That&#8217;s it&#8230; Other competing plugins require that you manually attach each lesson to a module. This takes ages!<\/p>\n<h3>Quizzes for your Courses<\/h3>\n<p>Create multiple choice and multiple answer quizzes and select from many options including maximum quiz attempts, if empty answers are allowed, your quiz welcome message and more. Quizzes can also be attached to courses similar as lessons.<\/p>\n<h3>Modern App-Like User Interface<\/h3>\n<p>WP Courses leverages many modern web technologies that allow for extremely quick content loading times as well as lessons and courses that load without having to refresh the page. This leads to a seamless and quick navigation experience for your users that will keep your students more engaged with your course content.<\/p>\n<h3>User Profiles<\/h3>\n<p>WP Courses has a robust profile section with viewed lesson tracking, completed lesson tracking, course progress tracking and quiz results.<\/p>\n<h3>Integrates Seamlessly with Practically Any Theme<\/h3>\n<p>WP Courses has been designed to seamlessly integrate with any theme inlcuding popular theme and website builders like Divi and Elementor. There are also plenty of design options to help match the design of your website. All courses will be seamlessly integrated with your existing website content.<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile-Friendly Courses<\/h3>\n<p>Courses are easy to navigate and look beautiful on any device. All courses will display a mobile friendly navigation and content structure.<\/p>\n<h3>No Coding Required<\/h3>\n<p>No coding knowledge is necessary for creating great looking courses.<\/p>\n<h3>Progress Tracking for all Courses<\/h3>\n<p>Keep your students engaged with progress tracking. Icons and progress bars show your students which lessons they&#8217;ve viewed and completed. You can also view any of your student&#8217;s progress in the admin area, broken down by lesson and course.<\/p>\n<h3>Courses Analytics Dashboard<\/h3>\n<p>See which courses are the most popular, which students are most engaged and how many people are viewing and completing lessons of which course each day.<\/p>\n<h3>Restrict Course Lesson Content<\/h3>\n<p>Restrict your course lesson content to logged in users only with the click of a button. Individual course lessons can be restricted for fine control over your content&#8217;s visibility.<\/p>\n<h3>Seamless Course Browsing Experience<\/h3>\n<p>Browse courses by category or in one large collection. Each course has its own content with an area for a description, video and any other type of content you&#8217;d like to include.<\/p>\n<h3>Actively Supported and Developed<\/h3>\n<p>This courses plugin is actively supported and developed with new updates and features added regularly.<\/p>\n<h3>Full Translation Support<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcoursesplugin.com\/lesson\/how-to-translate-wp-courses\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">A tutorial on translating WP Courses can be found here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Premium Version &#8211; Sell, Market and Engage<\/h3>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https:\/\/wpcoursesplugin.com\/wp-courses-premium\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">premium version<\/a> available which includes the following add-ons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce Integration: Sell your courses right in your WooCommerce store.

The course is added-value for the book and videos so I'll not be charging, therefore I can't tell you how it integrates with payment systems, i'm afraid.\n\nI'd like to thank Myles for making the basic plugin free and for such amazing and rapid support.

I particularly like how simple it is to get up and running with badges and quizzes. The PRO pack is worth it for the files, emails and other features.\n\nOn the support side, Myles is really great - open to ideas, quick to respond and on the ball. If you've struggled with other LMS plugins, this one is quicker, easier and more streamlined. Go for it!\n\nUpdate for 2022-06 :\n\nI've been lucky enough to work with the new user interface in version 3 for a while now and I have to say that I have been continually impressed by the support and assistance I've been getting. The new version is really impressive with the UX improvements and the quiz enhancements. This plugin just gets better and better.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great way to do courses<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tree2bars\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f828d7e3744ffdd0f47172ae13d61301?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f828d7e3744ffdd0f47172ae13d61301?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/tree2bars\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">tree2bars<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 2, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It is a great way to build courses but I hope in the future to have the possibility to customize more and more every single part of it.\nThanks<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
