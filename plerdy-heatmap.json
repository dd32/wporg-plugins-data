Especially if you send paid traffic to it, Plerdy has all the necessary tools for such conversion rate optimization (BizGrow).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlerdy is a great value for money. It&#8217;s less expensive than Hotjar and has all the necessary features for my website optimization (danijel58).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou no longer need to guess why the conversion rates are poor. Plerdy gives a clear view of user activity helping anyone from small startups to enterprises make smart decisions (Kerem C).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s my secret weapon to understanding customer behavior on a website. It has heatmaps, session recordings, SEO audits, forms analytics and popups, funnels tracking, etc. As a result, you can optimize a website to enhance UX and improve the CTR of any online store (Borislav K).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI find this tool for heatmaps and screen recordings work much better than the one I used before. I also like the fact that it integrates with the Google Search console (Sean_LeadScrape).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlerdy is better than Hotjar since instead of focusing on how a single person uses the entire website, it captures individual pages. Thanks to this, you can optimize template pages (e.g., landing or product pages) (narekzograbian).<\/p>\n",

Especially if you send paid traffic to it, Plerdy has all the necessary tools for such conversion rate optimization (BizGrow).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlerdy is a great value for money. It&#8217;s less expensive than Hotjar and has all the necessary features for my website optimization (danijel58).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou no longer need to guess why the conversion rates are poor. Plerdy gives a clear view of user activity helping anyone from small startups to enterprises make smart decisions (Kerem C).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s my secret weapon to understanding customer behavior on a website. It has heatmaps, session recordings, SEO audits, forms analytics and popups, funnels tracking, etc. As a result, you can optimize a website to enhance UX and improve the CTR of any online store (Borislav K).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI find this tool for heatmaps and screen recordings work much better than the one I used before. I also like the fact that it integrates with the Google Search console (Sean_LeadScrape).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlerdy is better than Hotjar since instead of focusing on how a single person uses the entire website, it captures individual pages. Thanks to this, you can optimize template pages (e.g., landing or product pages) (narekzograbian).<\/p>\n",
