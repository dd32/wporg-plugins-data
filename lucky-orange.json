A few years ago we canceled the service.\n\n<strong>In August<\/strong> I reactivated Lucky Orange with the 7-day trial and it worked great. At the end of the week I added my credit card and it stopped working. When I logged into my account, it said the trial had expired. I didn't pay attention and noticed months later that Lucky Orange was billing my account $24\/month.\n\n<strong>\"We have no account in that name and don't have a $24 options<\/strong> their customer service people told me. I gave them all of the possible email addresses. It took multiple emails over several weeks before they discovered that, inexplicably, the funds were credited to an account under a former employee's email address, one I'd never logged in with. They reversed the final $24 charge but it took another email for them to refund the full amount they had charged me. (The only good part of this tragic tale.)\n\n<strong>Now, I can't get the plugin to work.<\/strong> I tried logging on and activating it with my existing account. That didn't work (it kept sending me to Lucky Orange classic). I deleted\/reinstalled the plugin and created a new account with a different email address. I copied in the code Lucky Orange gave me, and it didn't work. \n\n<strong>I contacted customer support.<\/strong> Correction: I tried to contact customer support using the support icon in the dashboard. It did nothing (as another reviewer mentioned). \n\n<strong>I've deleted my account<\/strong> and am researching alternatives to this disaster of a service.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Installing this plugin brings you back to 2010<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/owlgalaxy\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/87b5cf347d7b43f5f3757fa2ea9cc856?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/87b5cf347d7b43f5f3757fa2ea9cc856?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/owlgalaxy\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">OwlGalaxy <small>(owlgalaxy)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 9, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The idea was to this your service in conjunction with Wordpress. But the experience from the letgo was so bad that I have decided to look for other options.\n\nWhat's wrong? well everything the plugin is outdated and can't even login, the most important part of the service does not work. to make it even worse all the URLs go to the classic version. \n\nThis service should help your customers to grow their business but they are loosing all the wordpress users from the start. \n\nOK, lets try to \"message support\" from their own site but the button does absolute nothing.\n\nThis does not look good and would not recommend this plugin and even discourage it. Save time and look further<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not there yet<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jugglerdesign\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c80eaaefe99d19357b3222f22ebbbcf3?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c80eaaefe99d19357b3222f22ebbbcf3?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jugglerdesign\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jugglerdesign<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 26, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">There was no ability to add a site pre-created within the Lucky Orange site. \n\nAlso once i installed it it allowed users to see all of my sites.
