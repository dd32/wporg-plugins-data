Their ticketing support channel is just superb, very fast responses when something goes wrong. The other day I had an update issue where a rare bug caused my site to go into critical error, they responded like almost immediately, went deep into the problem, fixed it with no \"did you restart your Windows\" type of questions just to stall the responses. I truly appreciate support that immediately understands what level of game I am playing and where I don't have to go back and forth several times to actually get some higher level team to investigate.
