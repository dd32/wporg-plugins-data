How? By using appointment scheduling features that automate daily operations and provide online scheduling 24\/7. Appointments can be as short as 5 minutes, meaning the administration can schedule everything with Trafft &#8211; even receiving documentation which significantly boosts efficiency.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/trafft.com\/home-services\/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wp_org&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_campaign=wp_org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Home Services<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plumbers, handymen, and other home service providers use Trafft because it completely eliminates back-and-forth communication when clients schedule appointments. Home service providers can add an \u201cAddress\u201d custom field that customers fill in, and Trafft automatically finds Google Maps location. The result? They always know where to go!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/trafft.com\/cleaning-services\/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wp_org&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_campaign=wp_org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cleaning Services<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Professional cleaning companies love Trafft because it helps them focus on their work instead of administrative tasks.
