Would you think? I already installed the official most recent version and that is not the problem. The problem is that the license is not accepted for the tickets add-on. So it is literally in the ticket. Activating other add-ons does work.<br \/>It has now been 6 days. You will receive short answers from support, a maximum of 1 per day.

The design in the frontend is appealing and the idea behind it is well implemented in principle.<br \/>I like the knowledge base, which offers some functions that make the tool customisable.<br \/>However, I do not recommend using the plugin without a child theme, as I had to intervene in the code in many places to make the plugin usable.<br \/>The translation into German does not work in many places, although the language file displays the translation. Only hard-coding helped here.<br \/>Some of the add-ons are not worth the money because they are not sufficiently implemented.<br \/>I find it a pity that the developers have left hardly any room for customising the design. I have rarely had to make so many improvements to a plugin with my own CSS.<br \/>I can also hardly recommend the support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Despite all the criticism, I can recommend the tool if you have some knowledge.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">support for PREMIUM LICENSE<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"3 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"3\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/indrakus\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c71e79c3d35e118336b4ae9261100706?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c71e79c3d35e118336b4ae9261100706?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/indrakus\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">indrakus<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 28, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">ok<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Slick plugin and excellent support!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/killiannolan93\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7581a032393b1334614eba043a8a012e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7581a032393b1334614eba043a8a012e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/killiannolan93\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">killiannolan93<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 16, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Very happy with the plugin.
