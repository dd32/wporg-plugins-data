Straight into their project management tool.<\/p>\n<p>Stop getting feedback on your website in emails, spreadsheets or powerpoints. Instead enable your clients and team members to, without leaving the browser, submit high quality feedback with screenshot or recording plus other metadata like browser, device and so on.<\/p>\n<p>No more emails &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; which leaves your team like &#8220;What doesn&#8217;t work? What browser were you using?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Save on average 5 hours per project by getting feedback that you directly understand and can take action on!<\/p>\n<h4>How Feedbucket works<\/h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/IYXQwznJlyc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>When Feedbucket is installed on your WordPress site it enables visitors to submit feedback using annotated screenshots directly in their browser without registering or downloading an extension.<\/p>\n<p>For those harder to explain bugs or animations the visitor can record their screen. Again, all in the browser without the need to install any third-party software or extensions.<\/p>\n<p>Together with the screenshot or recording comes a lot of metadata like browser, device, resolution and so on. No more emails to the client asking what browser they are using.<\/p>\n<p>The feedback will flow straight into your existing project management tool. Feedbucket is not &#8220;yet another tool&#8221; that you and your team need to log into.

We use Feedbucket in live environment as we change the site continuously.\n\nFree plan without limitations is rare to find, where other similar tool only have 14 day trials. \n\nA final word though. This is a tool for sending feedback to developers from testers, so do not confuse with client feedback forms. Also I would say that Feedbucket works best with the integrations (we use Teamwork) that you can connect.\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
