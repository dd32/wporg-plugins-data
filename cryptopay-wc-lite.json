It natively supports <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/beycanpress.com\/cryptopay\/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cryptocurrency payments for WooCommerce<\/a><\/strong>, and can also be integrated with other plugins thanks to its API. You can also receive direct payments with crypto wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet and Phantom. With WalletConnect support, you can receive <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/beycanpress.com\/cryptopay\/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress cryptocurrency payments<\/a><\/strong> from mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Review WooCommerce crypto payment gateway with video<\/strong><\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3vaoFL4XG10?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p><strong>What advantages does CryptoPay provide you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you know, virtual POS and many other payment methods deduct commission from you. The only commission here is the \u201cgas\u201d fee that blockchain networks charge. So the money will be transferred directly to your account. You can receive payments with all blockchain networks that have the RPC API and support the wallet that the user is currently using, and tokens and native currencies under these networks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apart from that, here are the advantages that CryptoPay gives you:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No 3rd party service<\/li>\n<li>No withdrawal limit, fee, date<\/li>\n<li>1-2 business days and no weekend nonsense<\/li>\n<li>The money is in your account and in use on the same day <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Are you ready to speed up the process of receiving WooCommerce crypto payments on WordPress with CryptoPay?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comparison with other services:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>CryptoPay:<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n\u2705 All payments reach you directly. So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).<br \/>\n\u2705 There are no additional transaction fees other than the transaction fee that the paying user pays to the Blockchain network.<br \/>\n\u2705 Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.<br \/>\n\u2705 Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin.<br \/>\n\u2705 For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Other services:<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n\u274c Payments are generally not P2P (Peer to Peer). They first take the payment into their own wallet and then transfer it to you.<br \/>\n\u274c For taking the payment to them first and then transferring it to you.<br \/>\n\u274c The paying user pays transaction fee for Blockchain.<br \/>\n\u274c An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.<br \/>\n\u274c The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.<br \/>\n\u274c Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.<br \/>\n\u274c Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce. To integrate with other plugins, you need a serious programming knowledge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Free Version:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No commission<\/li>\n<li>Unlimited payments<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce payment gateway<\/li>\n<li>Limited EVM-based network support<\/li>\n<li>Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polygon<\/li>\n<li>MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet support<\/li>\n<li>Getting paid with native coins and certain stable coins<\/li>\n<li>Fast confirmation times as transactions are p2p<\/li>\n<li>Order is created first, then payment is received<\/li>\n<li>Payment transaction list<\/li>\n<li>Automatic update system<\/li>\n<li>Unlimited domains<\/li>\n<li>WordPress.org support<\/li>\n<li>Use testnet for testing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Version:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Domain license<\/li>\n<li>1 Year of updates<\/li>\n<li>1 Year of support<\/li>\n<li>All the features in the free package<\/li>\n<li>Unlimited EVM-based network support<\/li>\n<li>Unlimited coin payments support<\/li>\n<li>Lots of extra feature add-ons<\/li>\n<li>Lots of network support add-ons<\/li>\n<li>Bitcoin Payments<\/li>\n<li>Solana Payments<\/li>\n<li>Tron Payments<\/li>\n<li>Lots of converter API support add-ons<\/li>\n<li>Custom token support &amp; prices support<\/li>\n<li>Payment feature on the &#8220;Checkout&#8221; page<\/li>\n<li>WalletConnect support<\/li>\n<li>QR Code support<\/li>\n<li>Ticket based support<\/li>\n<li>Backend confirmation system<\/li>\n<li>Dark and light theme option<\/li>\n<li>Network sorting feature<\/li>\n<li>Dynamic block confirmation count setting<\/li>\n<li>CryptoPay payment details on the order page<\/li>\n<li>Easy integration with other plugins via API<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Highlights:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, EVM-based networks are supported. To receive payments from other networks such as Bitcoin, Solana and Tron, you need to purchase extra add-ons. You can accept payments from many Web3 wallets integrated for these networks. It is also available on networks that support address transfer (QR Code) payments.<\/li>\n<li>You can get pay with native money of blockchain networks or with tokens under these networks.<\/li>\n<li>You can receive payments in your own special currencies (tokens). It is enough to have a price list in one of the APIs you will see in the next article. For example Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko<\/li>\n<li>The Crypto Compare API is currently provided. In addition, there are Coin Market Cap, Coin Gecko, Moralis and Pancake Swap API add-ons. Pancake Swap only supports BSC network while Moralis supports EVM based networks and Solana. Crypto Compare, Coin Market Cap and Coin Gecko support all currencies listed in it, regardless of network.<\/li>\n<li>If your token has no value in any of the APIs in the previous article, you can set a price for your token against other currencies with the &#8220;Custom token prices&#8221; field.<\/li>\n<li>You can easily activate or deactivate the wallets, networks and currencies you want to accept payments from.<\/li>\n<li>The accuracy of the payments is checked via the RPC API. It even confirms the payment transaction after checking the address received and the amount sent.<\/li>\n<li>Payment approvals are double-checked both on the front-end and the back-end. That is, even if the user turns off the computer during payment and leaves. If the payment transaction is completely correct, it will be updated as pay completed.<\/li>\n<li>You can follow all transactions on the Transaction pages. Transaction ID and link, which network the transaction is on. You can see the data for which order was paid, the crypto amount paid, etc.<\/li>\n<li>You can easily activate and deactivate the networks and currencies you want to receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>If you are selling products without member registration, you can receive payment from your customers without having to register with the \u201cOnly logged in users can pay\u201d feature.<\/li>\n<li>You can choose what to update the product status to once the payment is complete.<\/li>\n<li>It can be easily integrated with other plugins with its APIs.<\/li>\n<li>Dark theme mode is available for your dark themes.<\/li>\n<li>With Loco Translate, you can easily translate into any language you want.<\/li>\n<li>You can easily move your settings with the backup system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Privacy notices<\/h4>\n<p>With the default configuration, this plugin, in itself, does not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>use cookies;<\/li>\n<li>track users by stealth;<\/li>\n<li>It only sends active plugin count and active feedback;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Translations<\/h4>\n<p>You can easily translate with Loco translate.<\/p>\n<p>Read documentation: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/beycanpress.gitbook.io\/cryptopay-docs\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation<\/a><\/strong><br \/>\nReview CryptoPay Premium: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/beycanpress.com\/cryptopay\/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cryptocurrency payments for WooCommerce<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n",

The only commission here is the \u201cgas\u201d fee that blockchain networks charge. So the money will be transferred directly to your account. You can receive payments with all blockchain networks that have the RPC API and support the wallet that the user is currently using, and tokens and native currencies under these networks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apart from that, here are the advantages that CryptoPay gives you:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No 3rd party service<\/li>\n<li>No withdrawal limit, fee, date<\/li>\n<li>1-2 business days and no weekend nonsense<\/li>\n<li>The money is in your account and in use on the same day <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Are you ready to speed up the process of receiving WooCommerce crypto payments on WordPress with CryptoPay?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comparison with other services:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>CryptoPay:<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n\u2705 All payments reach you directly. So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).<br \/>\n\u2705 There are no additional transaction fees other than the transaction fee that the paying user pays to the Blockchain network.<br \/>\n\u2705 Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.<br \/>\n\u2705 Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin.<br \/>\n\u2705 For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Other services:<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n\u274c Payments are generally not P2P (Peer to Peer). They first take the payment into their own wallet and then transfer it to you.<br \/>\n\u274c For taking the payment to them first and then transferring it to you.<br \/>\n\u274c The paying user pays transaction fee for Blockchain.<br \/>\n\u274c An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.<br \/>\n\u274c The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.<br \/>\n\u274c Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.<br \/>\n\u274c Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce.

It even confirms the payment transaction after checking the address received and the amount sent.<\/li>\n<li>Payment approvals are double-checked both on the front-end and the back-end. That is, even if the user turns off the computer during payment and leaves. If the payment transaction is completely correct, it will be updated as pay completed.<\/li>\n<li>You can follow all transactions on the Transaction pages.
