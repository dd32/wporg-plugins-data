They offered to provide a fix for the issue, but I had already moved on to another service. Instead, they gave me a refund, and I'm thankful for that. I've changed my review to a 3-star since the product didn't fit me, but the developers went out of their way to help me once they realized I was incredibly dissatisfied.\n\nI would give this product a try again if my new service does not work out.\n\n<blockquote>I have been using this product on my Easy Digital Downloads issue, and immediately after purchase, I noticed that the plugin breaks the discount display on the checkout template. I brought this issue to the developer's attention on February 27th. They replied on March 1st that they would look into it. I replied on the 17th for an update and have not received a reply since.\n\nI honestly wouldn't trust the product if the developers would not support it properly. I'll be seeking to get my money back.<\/blockquote><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Cart Lift is a really great abdandoned cart solution<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/design-kink\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/03386625bf2cab4eaa94f87ebf9b8254?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/03386625bf2cab4eaa94f87ebf9b8254?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/design-kink\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">design-kink <small>(Design-Kink)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 15, 2023<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I love the speed and simplicity of this plugin.  \nI had it working in 5 minutes without reading any documentation. \nEverything just makes sense. \nI tested the plugin thoroughly and it does everything I want. \n\nIt captures the emails if a user is logged in, but even if they aren't, all they needed to do was enter their email, if they leave the page, it's still captured! For that reason I changed the checkout to have the email field at the top. \n\nYou can write your own Email reminder or use their template. \nYou can create a sequence of emails to remind customers to complete their purchase. You can set the emails to be sent after an hour, then a day or more. \nThen finally after a few days you can also send them a discount offer to tempt them back. \n\nMy client asked me to create an abandoned cart solution for them, so I had a look around, many of the plugins were to expensive ! \nI bought the pro version and am very happy with my purchase, I encourage you to get the Lifetime Plan plan while you still can, it's amazing value for money. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">This is what we need!
