I was searching and trying for like 3 days almost all plugins for google analytics and none of them worked properly, except this one. My needs: Multisite tracking, GA4 and Woocommerce Express Checkout tracking + Facebook Pixel tracking is a plus. Monsterinsights too blown up hence I don't need the data in WordPress but in GA that's the whole point of adding this tracking. Pixelyoursite unstable and very complicated to setup. The Woocommerce pro and free Orginal plugin are either unstable or don't support GA4 and very slow. ANalytify is actually fast but has no GA4 support and again i don't need the data in wordpress hence i prefer fast and slim sites.  \n\nThis Plugin (I just bought the pro version) works on multisite like a charm, even warns you if your multisite views are not correctly installed. Works with GA4 standalone or GA4 and the GA3 (Universal Tracking) Dual Setup. It works with Checheckout Express from Woocommerce and this in an extremely fast way. And yes it doesn't seem to have any problem with WP Rocket as caching. Maybe i sound overly exited but honestly after such frustration with the Big Brands I was lucky to find this one on a blog post. I really hope it'll find more support cause its easy and it works just like it should! Thanks again for this magic!\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
