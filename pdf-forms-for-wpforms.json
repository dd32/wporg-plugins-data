The filled PDF files can be saved on the web server.<\/p>\n<p>When your website visitor submits your WPForms form, the form in the PDF file is filled with the form information, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the WPForms notification. The resulting PDF file can also be downloaded by your website visitors if this option is enabled in your form&#8217;s options.<\/p>\n<p>What makes this plugin special is its approach to preparing PDF files. It is not generating PDF documents from scratch. It modifies the original PDF document that was prepared using third party software and supplied to the plugin.

No special software or PHP extensions are needed. Working with PDF files is done through <a href=\"https:\/\/pdf.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pdf.Ninja API<\/a>. It is recommended to have a working SSL\/TLS certificate validation with cURL.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20wpforms%20form%20fields%20mapped%20to%20pdf%20form%20fields%3F'>\nHow are WPForms form fields mapped to PDF form fields?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The field mapper tool allows you to map fields individually and, when needed, generate new WPForms fields on the fly. WPForms fields can be mapped to multiple PDF fields. Mappings can be associated with a specific PDF attachment or all PDF attachments. Field value mappings can also be created, allowing filled PDF fields to be filled with data that differs from the originally filled values.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='my%20fields%20are%20not%20getting%20filled%2C%20what%20is%20wrong%3F'>\nMy fields are not getting filled, what is wrong?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the mapping exists in the list of mappings and the field names match.<\/p>\n<p>If you attached an updated PDF file and your mappings were associated with the old attachment ID then those mappings will be deleted and you will need to recreate them.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes PDF form fields have validation scripts which prevent value with an incorrect format to be filled in. Date PDF fields must be <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/developers\/how-to-customize-date-format-in-the-date-smart-tag\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">formatted with a smart tag<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20update%20the%20attached%20pdf%20file%20without%20attaching%20a%20new%20version%20and%20losing%20attachment%20id%20associated%20mappings%20and%20embeds%3F'>\nHow do I update the attached PDF file without attaching a new version and losing attachment ID associated mappings and embeds?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try using the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/enable-media-replace\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Enable Media Replace plugin<\/a> to replace the PDF file in-place in the Media Library.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='my%20checkboxes%20and%2For%20radio%20buttons%20are%20not%20getting%20filled%2C%20what%20is%20wrong%3F'>\nMy checkboxes and\/or radio buttons are not getting filled, what is wrong?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure your PDF checkbox\/radio field&#8217;s exported value matches the value of the WPForms form&#8217;s checkbox value. Usually, it is &#8220;On&#8221; or &#8220;Yes&#8221;. If you need to display a different value in the WPForms form, you will need to create a value mapping.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to have multiselect checkboxes, however, PDFs can&#8217;t have multiple values with checkbox fields. You either need to switch to using a listbox in your PDF or rename your checkboxes such that each has a unique name and then map them appropriately.<\/p>\n<p>Some PDF viewers don&#8217;t render checkboxes correctly in some PDF files. You may be able to solve this issue by recreating the PDF in a different PDF editor. If you are still using Pdf.Ninja API v1, switching to v2 may resolve your issue.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20remove%20the%20watermark%20in%20the%20filled%20pdf%20files%3F'>\nHow do I remove the watermark in the filled PDF files?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https:\/\/pdf.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pdf.Ninja API website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

(Recommend using FoxIt PDF Creator for this.) Pro-Tip: Make sure to change the font and font size of these auto-generated form fields so that they are more legible than if you leave the font size set to \"auto\". I typically choose the font and font size that matches that used in creating the form for best results.<br \/>Step 3: In your WPForms form \"Settings\" tab, select \"PDF Forms\" and click \"Attach PDF file.\" Upload your PDF.<br \/>Step 4: Map existing WPForms form fields (left side) to \"PDF field\" (right side). If you're doing multiple forms, I recommend selecting the PDF field (on the right) that has the bracketed [] numbers next to them. These numbers match the bracketed number above where you attached the PDF. This helps to keep straight which documents you're mapping what fields to.<br \/>Step 5: If you have any images or signatures to map, you'll do this using the \"Image Embedding Tool\" section below the field mapping. Pick your field to map to which document, click \"Embed Image,\" and then draw where you want the image to be embedded (ie a signature line).<br \/><br \/>You're done except to test it's all working.
