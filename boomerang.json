        "description": "<p>Boomerang provides a simple interface for your users or customers to provide feedback about your goods or services. While created with feature requests in mind, you can use Boomerang to collect any form of feedback from your customers, staff, potential leads and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It all starts with a board. And with Boomerang, you can create as many as you want. Boards contain Boomerangs. These are the individual pieces of feedback your users provide. Whenever a user creates a &#8216;Boomerang&#8217;, it is assigned to a chosen board. So if you are a software company with multiple products, you are all set. If you run a chain of hotels, each hotel can have a board, and you can easily keep track of your feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where Boomerang get&#8217;s really clever. Each board has it&#8217;s own set of options. Because we know that collecting feedback may not be done the same way across your whole product or service offer. So go ahead and customise each one accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2728 Features<\/h3>\n<h4>A Modern User Interface<\/h4>\n<p>Boomerang features a slick user interface, closer to alternatives such as Canny or Frill. If you&#8217;ve used those (and cringed at the price they charge) you&#8217;ll feel right at home. Boomerang comes with it&#8217;s own global styles, so you can get started right away. However, if you are a web designer and happy using CSS, you can turn these off for a more native, non-opinionated experience.<\/p>\n<p>For administrators, nearly everything can be achieved on the front-end. Delete a Boomerang. Change it&#8217;s status. And so on. You deserve a great experience too.<\/p>\n<h4>Granular Control<\/h4>\n<p>The most basic Boomerang has a title, and some content. That&#8217;s it. Everything else a Boomerang might need, can be switched on individually. When you create a board, these are all turned off by default. The easiest way to learn what the features do is to turn them on, one at a time. Experiment with how feature rich you want your Boomerangs to be. And if you need a bit more guidance, each feature has a description to tell you more.<\/p>\n<h4>The Boomerang Block<\/h4>\n<p>The Boomerang archive comes with everything you need to create and list Boomerangs. A modern, AJAX-enabled form. AJAX-enabled filters to narrow down the Boomerang list. But how do you display it? Add your Boomerang listing to any page, using the Boomerang shortcode (you&#8217;ll see this at the top of each board&#8217;s settings page). Even easier, you could use the Boomerang Block to pick a board you&#8217;ve already created, and add that directly into your block editor.<\/p>\n<h4>Statuses<\/h4>\n<p>Some plugins don&#8217;t let you edit your statuses. Boomerang really doesn&#8217;t care what your statuses are. You create them, you edit them, you assign them to Boomerangs. And you do all that in the Boomerang Status Center. You&#8217;ll find it in the Boomerang menu.<\/p>\n<h4>Amazing Help and Support<\/h4>\n<p>Feel free to ask questions in the plugin support forum. You can see the link at the top of this page. Alternatively, you will find a &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; item on the Boomerang menu.Please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out, while we are creating a full set of technical docs and so on.
