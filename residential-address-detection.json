Once you get to the checkout page you will be disappointed to find out that every time you update a part of the shipping address, as you update the whole thing, it triggers with each field left.\n\n1. Change the street address - Plugin detects address\n2. Change City - Plugin detects address\n3. Change State - Plugin detects address\n4. Change Zip Code - Plugin detects address\n\nSo for every address change for purposes of getting a freight quote you are actually verifying an address 4 times, not counting the one verification that may be triggered on your cart page even without a street address.\n\nDo better, Devs. This is not the correct way for your plugin to work.\n\nHere is the response I received below.:\n\n<pre><code>Hi Anthony,\n\nThe Developer&#039;s response is pasted below, there is no issue, the behavior is as expected from woo commerce and we do not need to make any changes to the theme.\nPlease see if this works for you, if not, I will be glad to process full refunds on your subscriptions, if the App is unable to serve your purpose\n******************************************************************\nRequest sending behavior showing in the customer video is working fine. Maybe, the customer is new to WordPress. When a customer is changing any field on the checkout page, always request will send. It\u2019s woocommerce default behavior. Woocommerce has validation on the checkout page for Receiver Address, City, State, and Country. These should be filled. When any field will be changed, a new request will be sent. You can see clearly in the video that the customer is changing the address every time. So WooCommerce and plugins have triggered the requests.\n***********************************************<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
