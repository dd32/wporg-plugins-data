        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20personalizewp%3F'>\nWhat is PersonalizeWP?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>PersonalizeWP is a WordPress plugin designed to add personalization features to WordPress. It follows similar principles to Enterprise platforms such as Episerver, Optimizely and Sitecore and works in conjunction with the Block editor to provide a simple and clear pathway to this functionality for content authors and admins.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20use%20it%20for%3F'>\nWhat can I use it for?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use PersonalizeWP to personalize content to your users, based on actions that they have taken, or criteria such as which countries they are accessing your site from. We have included basic rules into the plugin to provide a starting point and you can add your own rules, based on a set of conditions, and then apply those to any blocks you wish.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20personalizewp%3F'>\nHow do I use PersonalizeWP?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have the plugin installed and activated, a PersonalizeWP option will appear in the Block Settings sidebar in the editor when you are editing a block. Within this, you will be given the choice to choose a rule and determine an action if that rule is met. For instance, you may wish to add a content block with a message that is only shown to the user if they come from a particular country, or if they have purchased a product from your store. Feel free to play around and let us know if you think.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20limitations%3F'>\nAre there any limitations?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The actions that you can take when a rule is met, are currently limited to Show or Hide a block. We will be adding new actions in a future release. The plugin does not work with the Classic Block &#8211; which is due to be deprecated. You can use the Convert to Blocks feature to transform the Classic Block into independent blocks, which can then take advantage of PersonalizeWP.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20always%20be%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nWill the plugin always be free to use?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will always have a free version of the plugin, but in the future, it is likely that we will add a Pro version which will offer additional features.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='need%20help%3F'>\nNeed help?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check our <a href=\"https:\/\/personalizewp.com\/knowledge-base\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base<\/a> or contact us through our <a href=\"https:\/\/personalizewp.com\/resources\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
