I have not found any issues with it. I dont know if the people that are complaining are simply frustrated with some lacking of coding skills on their part? \nI have worked with Wordpress for over 10 years and handled close to a 1000 different plugins. Yes sometimes  you get crap coding. Sometimes you get a wonderful plugin. This plugin is also great for a fine tooth restrictions.. being able to narrow it down to precise link if need be.\nToo many people come to the wordpress directory looking for free... spending hours looking for something free. When in the end alot of the Free plugins lack updating and many get left behind.\nYou get what you pay for and at least by paying for a plugin you a supporting future development and updates.\n Alot of you out there who are building sites, dreaming of making it big. Need to quit being so cheap! because in the end, you get what you pay for. This will only delay your site development and it is something customers will sniff out as a weak site.\nI rarely leave reviews on plugins, but I have gotten tired of reading complaints and bashing of those who create. So I am taking my rant out in this review. \n\nI do not know the developer of this plugin, but i do recognize a pattern of <strong>frustrated idiots<\/strong> who cant take a moment to write a developer.
