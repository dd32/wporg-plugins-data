As always, the Drip team make life on WP easy by developing seemingly sophisticated tools in way that makes life easy. \n\nWe used this plugin to add Drip tags and back-end marketing automation for free reports we provide on pages and pop-ups, instead of using a complete (and heavier\/slower) automation tool like WP Fusion users are tag once they land on the report page (not during user creation or email sign-up, reducing load times). (BTW, we use WP Fusion on all of our other sites for Drip integration). \n\nEasy plugin, works well straight out of the box. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
