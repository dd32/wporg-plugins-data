FooSales POS can only access a website URL that is linked to your account so it&#8217;s very important that you enter the correct web address. Installation is quick and easy.<\/p>\n<h4>Support<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foosales.com\/support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ask us a question<\/a><\/p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.3 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.1.0 <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles all the file transfers. To do an automatic installation of FooSales POS, login to your WordPress admin area, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8216;Add New&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;FooSales&#8221; and click &#8216;Search Plugins&#8217;. Once you&#8217;ve found the FooSales POS plugin, you can view details about it such as release information, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the FooSales POS plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Updating<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work seamlessly, but as always though, please ensure that you back-up your website just in case.<\/p>\n<p>If for some reason you encounter issues with the shop\/category pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and clicking &#8216;Save&#8217;. That should revert things back to normal.<\/p>\n",

WooCommerce currently integrates with over 100 different payment gateways.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20languages%20do%20the%20foosales%20apps%20support%3F'>\nWhat languages do the FooSales apps support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The FooEvents apps currently support: English, Afrikaans, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20process%20card%20payments%20through%20foosales%20pos%3F'>\nCan I process card payments through FooSales POS?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS currently offers a direct integration with Square Readers and the Square point of sale app (Square POS) to process payments. FooSales also supports Stripe Terminal readers and manual card entries. If you don&#8217;t use Square or Stripe, card payments can be manually processed using any third-party card reader of your choice and set to &#8220;Card Payment&#8221; at checkout.

With this option you do not require the customer&#8217;s physical card or reader hardware to process the payment. You can also use any other payment method to process the order over the phone and complete the order in FooSales with the selected payment type.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20foosales%20pos%20just%20a%20plugin%3F'>\nIs FooSales POS just a plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS is an app based WooCommerce POS and is available on iPad, Android tablet and a web app. The apps connect directly to your WooCommerce store using a lightweight WordPress plugin. Our native apps provide various benefits that simply cannot be achieved using plugin based POS solutions. These include offline mode, more reliable hardware integration, built-in camera support for barcode scanning, and greater choice of supported printers and card readers. That said, we also offer a web app so you get the best of both worlds.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20makes%20foosales%20pos%20different%20from%20other%20pos%20systems%3F'>\nWhat makes FooSales POS different from other POS systems?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most traditional point of sale systems are stand-alone systems and are not designed to natively work with WooCommerce. They rely on bridging plugins to sync product catalogs between WooCommerce and their own catalog management systems. FooSales on the other hand is an WooCommerce first platform. FooSales POS connects directly to WooCommerce and uses it as a central database. This means you won&#8217;t have any syncing issues and your data is always secure and up to date, no matter how many stores or devices you connect.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20run%20the%20foosales%20pos%20web%20app%20on%20my%20own%20domain%3F'>\nCan I run the FooSales POS web app on my own domain?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can but you will need to purchase the <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/products\/foosales-for-woocommerce\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FooSales for WooCommerce<\/a> extension which is sold exclusively on the WooCommerce Marketplace.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='does%20foosales%20support%20products%20that%20are%20sold%20in%20decimal%20quantities%20%28length%2C%20weight%20etc.%29%3F'>\nDoes FooSales support products that are sold in decimal quantities (length, weight etc.)?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! FooSales has built-in functionality that allows you to sell products using decimal quantities but this needs to first be configured in FooSales. You can even sell regular products alongside products that use decimal quantities. Please refer to this <a href=\"https:\/\/help.foosales.com\/docs\/topics\/products\/decimal-quantities\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help document<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20charge%20for%20technical%20support%3F'>\nDo you charge for technical support?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support is free, however, the only support channel that we currently offer is via email.

All of your data remains on your own website, tablet or computer. FooSales POS simply connects to your website, pulls your product catalog, and sends new orders back to your site. FooSales POS also complies with the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for added peace of mind.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20the%20foosales%20pos%20setup%20process%20take%3F'>\nHow long does the FooSales POS setup process take?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Setup only takes a minute.

The most technical part is installing the FooSales POS WordPress plugin and connecting your WooCommerce store to FooSales POS. The FooSales POS WordPress plugin can be installed directly from your WordPress admin area by selecting &#8216;Add New&#8217; in the Plugins menu and then search for FooSales POS. You can also download and install the plugin manually if you prefer.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend visiting the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.foosales.com\/docs\/topics\/getting-started\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Started<\/a> page which will guide you through the entire setup process.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20foosales%20pos%20without%20woocommerce%3F'>\nCan I use FooSales POS without WooCommerce?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not at the moment.

The tight integration with the square terminal is the icing on the cake, again it works perfectly for us.\n\nWe use the web app and being able to build orders quickly for customers in store saves us lots of time and keeps our customers happy.\n\nThanks<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great application with bugs, need improvement<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dblii\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/64bb2c86c94e5156722914707600e6fd?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/64bb2c86c94e5156722914707600e6fd?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dblii\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Yorgos <small>(Dblii)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 9, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Great application with bugs, need improvement. the most important thing is that it stops working and unfortunately you can not operate your store until they answer you, this does not make sense because if it is a Friday they can answer you after 2 days.

I use it for everything from inventory updates, price updates to actual sales and quick lookups (my SKU's are so many that I cannot remember all item prices). I use on my iPads with the inbuilt camera as barcode scanner during checkout.\nIf you run a store, this is FASTER and better than WooCommerce's original POS (I have the paid version installed, no comparison)\nFrequent updates to keep current with the latest woocommerce...\nNot to mention, the BEST Customer support ever. They helped me during early (March) pandemics, that is the actual reason why I stuck to them and got to know the product better.\nThanks guys!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Star mPOP and Foo Sales<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/isodos\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a934f0055b02ffb3743bccd5c34789e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9a934f0055b02ffb3743bccd5c34789e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/isodos\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">isodos<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 5, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Their recent update disabled all our POS's across the network, disabling all stations, resulting in total chaos.

It is a beautiful application with native iOS app that works perfectly and is super fast. I have mobile technicians who perform work in customers' homes and I need them to be able to put together an invoice and collect payment while in the home. The vast majority of customers prefer to use a card. It's just too tedious for the technician to create an order in FooSales and then go to the Square app to collect the payment, then go back to FooSales to record the information. It would be so much simpler to just setup Square to do everything. If you have a strictly cash-based mobile business that you need to sync inventory with an online store this could work. Or if you have the patience to pop into another app to run a card, FooSales looks awesome.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">so good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jimmynguyen2019\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/424f9a9450464bc9c80babbd1bf880f9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/424f9a9450464bc9c80babbd1bf880f9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jimmynguyen2019\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jimmynguyen2019<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 12, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">5 star for team ^^!\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Not a Standalone POS<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/kevin9389\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6ac60db07bfb04eb6b0a33f5e4458b7d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6ac60db07bfb04eb6b0a33f5e4458b7d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/kevin9389\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">kevin9389<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 4, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">FooSales is not a standalone point of sales.

It even supports updating stock from the app and doesn't allow you to oversell inventory (which other POS apps frustratingly allow).\n\nMy minor issues are that the scanning barcodes doesn't work on Ipad or Android and that sales tax is displayed incorrectly until the transaction completes (it pulls the correct data from the site directly to process the sale).\n\nSupport was very quick and easy to reach although they claimed they were unable to help with the bar code issue unless I was using an actual barcode scanner (the app supports the built-in camera and Bluetooth scanner).\n\nI'm leaving 4 stars until the issues are resolved but this POS is amazing and absolutely worth dealing with the minor issues.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
