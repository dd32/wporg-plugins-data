We\u2019re changing it. You won\u2019t need SSL certificates, shopping carts, or piles of books in your basement. All you\u2019ll need is a WordPress website. Oh, and a book.<\/p>\n<p>MyBookTable allows you to have your own bookstore that links to online bookstores where visitors can buy the book.<\/p>\n<p>You can find a <strong>live demo<\/strong> of MyBookTable in action <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stormhillmedia.com\/book-table\/\" title=\"MyBookTable Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>FEATURES<\/h4>\n<h4>Easy to Use<\/h4>\n<p>With a simple interface, help text and tutorial videos, MyBookTable is designed with the novice user in mind. In version 2.0 we made MyBookTable even easier to use with usability improvements throughout the plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>Drag and Drop Control<\/h4>\n<p>Easily control which books appear at the top of your book table page with a simple drag-and-drop interface.<\/p>\n<h4>Make Your Individual Book Pages Look Amazing<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable allows you to easily make great-looking book pages. Whether you want a list of books or a individual book page, MyBookTable gives you maximum control with minimum hassle.<\/p>\n<h4>Kindle Instant Preview (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable 3 will now officially come with Kindle Instant Preview. Readers can read the first few pages of your Kindle book without ever having to leave your book page or download a PDF.<\/p>\n<h4>Social Media Integration<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable makes it easy for visitors to like and share your books on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google+. It also works with plugins like ShareThis.<\/p>\n<h4>Beautiful Buy Buttons<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable comes with Buy Buttons for the following stores:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alibris<\/li>\n<li>Amazon<\/li>\n<li>Amazon Kindle<\/li>\n<li>Apple iBooks Button<\/li>\n<li>Audible<\/li>\n<li>Barnes &amp; Noble<\/li>\n<li>Barnes &amp; Noble Nook<\/li>\n<li>Book Depository Button<\/li>\n<li>BookBaby<\/li>\n<li>Books-A-Million<\/li>\n<li>Christian Book Distributor (CBD)<\/li>\n<li>CreateSpace<\/li>\n<li>GoodReads<\/li>\n<li>Gumroad<\/li>\n<li>Indiebound<\/li>\n<li>Kobo<\/li>\n<li>Lifeway<\/li>\n<li>Mardel<\/li>\n<li>Powell\u2019s<\/li>\n<li>Scribd<\/li>\n<li>Smashwords<\/li>\n<li>Sony Reader<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Universal Buy Button<\/h4>\n<p>Create a button that points to any site on the web. You have full control over both the text and the link.<\/p>\n<h4>International Mode (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable is partnering with Geniuslink to add link localization to MyBookTable. This means readers in England will automatically be sent to Amazon.co.uk and Canadian readers can click the same button to go to Amazon.ca.<\/p>\n<h4>Audiobook Mode (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable will come with an audio player so readers can sample your audiobook right on the book page. We are also adding fields for Narrator and Audiobook Price.<\/p>\n<h4>Book Import\/Export (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>This user-requested feature will be a huge time saver for authors with multiple websites. With MyBookTable 2.0 you can export your books from one website and import them into another.<\/p>\n<h4>Enhanced Children&#8217;s Book Support (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>Not every author writes children\u2019s books. But those that do want an Illustrator Field so they can give credit to the illustrator of their books. Users will be able to click on an illustrator\u2019s name to see all the books by that illustrator.<\/p>\n<h4>Star Rating Support (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>It turns out that not everyone who uses MyBookTable is an author. Readers use MyBookTable to post reviews of books they&#8217;ve read. Now MyBookTable has a Star Rating feature so that those book reviewers can rate the books they are reviewing.<\/p>\n<h4>Endorsements Section (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable 3 has a special section for you to show off endorsements, blurbs, and accolades. Book blurbs can now look better than ever before.<\/p>\n<h4>Buy Button Style Packs<\/h4>\n<p>Customize your store by showing some of the buy buttons as a bulleted list. Also, choose from multiple buy button color schemes.<\/p>\n<h4>Buy Button Shadow Box<\/h4>\n<p>Have a a lot of buy buttons cluttering up your book pages? No worries. MyBookTable 2.0 allows you to show a single &#8220;buy now&#8221; button that opens a shadow box with all your buy buttons.<\/p>\n<h4>Featured Book Widget<\/h4>\n<p>Feature a book on your sidebar with just a few clicks. You can even add multiple books by adding multiple widgets.<\/p>\n<h4>Mobile Responsive<\/h4>\n<p>If your WordPress theme is mobile responsive, MyBookTable will react similarly, delivering maximum compatibility for visitors on phones and tablets.<\/p>\n<h4>Recommend Books<\/h4>\n<p>Do you want to sell books by other authors? MyBookTable now has a &#8220;Recommended Books&#8221; tag out of the box so you can sell not only your books but other authors&#8217; books as well.<\/p>\n<h4>Advanced Search Engine Optimization<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Search-Optimized Page for Each Book<\/strong><br \/>\nHaving a search-optimized book page may seem small, but this option makes a huge difference in how many people find your book. Most authors cram all their books onto one page. With so many titles per page, no one book can rank or get coveted Google juice. MyBookTable allows you to create a page for each book, as well as a page with all books listed, so you get the best of both worlds. Edit one and it updates the other. This gives you a much better chance of ranking higher when someone searches for one of your titles.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native SEO Controls<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t currently use an SEO plugin, MyBookTable provides meta titles and descriptions as if you did, complete with optimized defaults in case you don\u2019t want to bother optimizing it yourself.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced SEO Integration<\/strong><br \/>\nMyBookTable integrates with popular SEO plugins like WordPress SEO by Yoast and Scribe SEO. If you use one of these plugins, you get full access to their power.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Semantic Markup and OpenGraph<\/strong><br \/>\nMyBookTable has built-in semantic markup, giving you the edge on search engines like Google and social networks like Facebook. We do all the heavy lifting for you, so your pages are naturally searchable.  This should improve Search Engine Optimization and social optimization.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Built-In Tutorial Videos<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable has built-in tutorial videos showing you how to use the plugin for maximum effect.<\/p>\n<h4>Compatibility Mode<\/h4>\n<p>With thousands of WordPress themes in existence, we can\u2019t guarantee that MBT will work with every theme. So we have created a compatibility mode that allows for maximum compatibility with your theme. MyBookTable integrates with all the major theme frameworks, including Genesis, Woo Canvas, most Elegant Themes, and many Theme Forest Themes. Thesis is the only framework known not to work.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy Shortcode Interface<\/h4>\n<p>MBT adds an icon to the WordPress WYSIWYG Editor that allows you to add MyBookTable shortcodes to your site with just a couple of clicks.<\/p>\n<h4>Built-in Breadcrumbs<\/h4>\n<p>We have added breadcrumbs, which will not only make your book pages easier to use for your visitors, but will also improve search engine optimization. These breadcrumbs are fully compatible with the Genesis or Woo Canvas breadcrumb systems.<\/p>\n<h4>GetNoticed! Theme Integration<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable can import books from Michael Hyatt&#8217;s GetNoticed! theme. MyBookTable and GetNoticed! now work together seamlessly.<\/p>\n<h4>Book Widgets<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable gives you several cool book widgets. Including a featured book widget, genre widget, series widget, and more!<\/p>\n<h4>Premium Features (Available with Paid Upgrade)<\/h4>\n<h4>Affiliate Integration (Professional Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon, BN.com, and CBD.com all offer affiliate programs that help you supplement your income as an author. You won\u2019t have to sell your book out of your garage to make more money. It also integrates seamlessly with leading SEO Plugins like Yoast and Scribe.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate platforms supported:<br \/>\n* Amazon (Amazon, Kindle)<br \/>\n* Commission Junction (Audible)<br \/>\n* Linkshare (Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo)<\/p>\n<h4>Landing Page Mode (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable 3 can now create landing pages for your books. Landing Page Mode is a total redesign of how a book page looks. It must be seen to be believed. This landing page can be used to power a whole website for your book title or just to make your book pages look better.<\/p>\n<p>= Reading Group Resources Section Pro Upgrade Required)=<br \/>\nMyBookTable Pro now comes with a brand new section where you can add resources for reading clubs and book groups. The more resources you provide book clubs, the more they will want to read your book.<\/p>\n<p>Suggested materials include:<br \/>\n* A PDF Download of Discussion Questions<br \/>\n* Bulk Ordering Link<br \/>\n* Powerpoint Companion<br \/>\n* Chapter Excerpts PDF<br \/>\n* Discussion Video<\/p>\n<h4>Grid View (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Show your books in a responsive grid view.  This is a great option for sites with a lot of books to show.<\/p>\n<h4>Notify Me Button (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Allow visitors to sign up for book updates by subscribing to your MailChimp list. This button can act as a Pre-Pre-Order button for books that are still a work in process.<\/p>\n<h4>UIEE Book Importer (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable can also import books from a Universal Information Exchange Environment (UIEE) file.<\/p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20i%20need%20to%20ship%20books%20if%20i%20use%20mybooktable%3F'>\nWill I need to ship books if I use MyBookTable?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! The whole idea behind MyBookTable is that Amazon (and other online retailers) do all the hard work of taking credit card information and dealing with postage and shipping. All you do is list your books and get your affiliate commission and royalties. The developer level does integrate with PayPal so that if you do want to ship your own books, you can. But we imagine most users won&#8217;t use that feature.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20be%20an%20author%20to%20use%20mybooktable%3F'>\nDo I need to be an author to use MyBookTable?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!

I use the professional MyBookTable plugin, and find it worth the price. Overall I find it to be incredibly useful and an invaluable part of my website. I like the ability to add my book descriptions easily to individual blog posts, and to aggregate a list of online retailers for my book.\n\nThere are two areas where the plugin could be improved in the future: \n\nA) Make the book cover the post\u2019s automatic featured image. Currently, it defaults to the site\u2019s default image instead. Under Screen Options there is no way to add a featured image to a book, so the post thumbnail is not the book cover. I\u2019ve worked around this for social media by installing Social Rocket for the time being.  \n\nB) For accessibility reasons I use a tablet to design my site, and currently, adding book links to other retailers must be done on a desktop or laptop computer, and trying to do so on a tablet, the field where you paste your book\u2019s link is greyed out, so I always have to switch gears and use a computer.\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Is this Plugin going to be updated<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/stormgrayson\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f5fa17b060105243a56542bfdc1761af?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f5fa17b060105243a56542bfdc1761af?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/stormgrayson\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">stormgrayson<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 23, 2019<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Love this plugin as it is the only one of its kind that actually works for my sites.

The Amazon affiliate program somewhat facilitates this process but the advertised ISBN lookup feature would have been a real treat.\nSupport promises tickets will be answered quickly however, some of them have been open for months.

Genius. So many use cases. Authors selling books, check. Avid readers who want to blog about the books they love, check. An easy, intuitive way to sort these out - not so much. \n\nBossy styles in plugin CSS - I have to override them all to match my site branding, and the default layouts are pretty clunky. \n\nNo Featured Image - Can't create my own layouts with popular page builders because  none of them can find the book image, and I can't even upload a featured image as a copy to be found.\n\nThe publishers seem really passionate about helping authors grow online, and that is awesome. I wish they would get bought by a bigger company that can build something with better features and cleaner code. I kind of wish I would have just build this myself using a custom post type plugin for the client site I am building. I keep bumping into limitations, or things they thought of, but aren't quite there, and places where I have to re-invent the square wheel on this one and that is frustrating. I would get the paid version if I trusted some of these issues would be more designer-site-builder friendly. \n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Poor support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gett\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6294dce03fd8adff62a2b0218f0a667?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6294dce03fd8adff62a2b0218f0a667?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gett\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">gett<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 24, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I understand that for premium support I need to buy the plugin, but I expect the minimum support for free version.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Perfect Tool For Simplified Book Promotion<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rmharrington1\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eac08cc64f8819f606b20be19ffd0a45?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/eac08cc64f8819f606b20be19ffd0a45?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rmharrington1\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">rmharrington1<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 26, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Began using MyBookTable around five months ago. Liked what I saw and the simplicity of operation. A few weeks after setting up the free version, I went pro. Are there any program upgrades I would like to see? A few. But am I happy with the current progress of the plugin? Absolutely. \n\nBest points...\n1) Easy bulk import of book data from Amazon and other top online publishing sites.\n2) Merges well with other WP plugins\n3) Automatically deals with most of the SEO process\n4) Enables simple modification of the downloaded book details and images\n5) Accepts manual as well as automated book entries.\n6) Simplified shortcode input while also presenting several default book formatting options.\n\nAll in all, this plugin is perfect for bulk book promotion as well as personal book promotions. Easily handles multiple authors without need of setting up long-tail author profiles, yet also enables webmaster discretion with each author specifics.\n\nGet it. You will be pleased.

I have over 100 books in my database and it runs smoothly. \n\nI love the way it displays books. I love the widgets it provides and I really love the way you can import the information for multiple books from Amazon just by entering the ISBN or Amazon ID number. Plus it fully supports the Amazon Affiliate program.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"

You have full control over both the text and the link.<\/p>\n<h4>International Mode (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable is partnering with Geniuslink to add link localization to MyBookTable. This means readers in England will automatically be sent to Amazon.co.uk and Canadian readers can click the same button to go to Amazon.ca.<\/p>\n<h4>Audiobook Mode (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable will come with an audio player so readers can sample your audiobook right on the book page. We are also adding fields for Narrator and Audiobook Price.<\/p>\n<h4>Book Import\/Export (New in 3.0)<\/h4>\n<p>This user-requested feature will be a huge time saver for authors with multiple websites.

MyBookTable now has a &#8220;Recommended Books&#8221; tag out of the box so you can sell not only your books but other authors&#8217; books as well.<\/p>\n<h4>Advanced Search Engine Optimization<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Search-Optimized Page for Each Book<\/strong><br \/>\nHaving a search-optimized book page may seem small, but this option makes a huge difference in how many people find your book. Most authors cram all their books onto one page. With so many titles per page, no one book can rank or get coveted Google juice. MyBookTable allows you to create a page for each book, as well as a page with all books listed, so you get the best of both worlds. Edit one and it updates the other. This gives you a much better chance of ranking higher when someone searches for one of your titles.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native SEO Controls<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t currently use an SEO plugin, MyBookTable provides meta titles and descriptions as if you did, complete with optimized defaults in case you don\u2019t want to bother optimizing it yourself.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced SEO Integration<\/strong><br \/>\nMyBookTable integrates with popular SEO plugins like WordPress SEO by Yoast and Scribe SEO. If you use one of these plugins, you get full access to their power.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Semantic Markup and OpenGraph<\/strong><br \/>\nMyBookTable has built-in semantic markup, giving you the edge on search engines like Google and social networks like Facebook. We do all the heavy lifting for you, so your pages are naturally searchable.  This should improve Search Engine Optimization and social optimization.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Built-In Tutorial Videos<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable has built-in tutorial videos showing you how to use the plugin for maximum effect.<\/p>\n<h4>Compatibility Mode<\/h4>\n<p>With thousands of WordPress themes in existence, we can\u2019t guarantee that MBT will work with every theme. So we have created a compatibility mode that allows for maximum compatibility with your theme. MyBookTable integrates with all the major theme frameworks, including Genesis, Woo Canvas, most Elegant Themes, and many Theme Forest Themes. Thesis is the only framework known not to work.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy Shortcode Interface<\/h4>\n<p>MBT adds an icon to the WordPress WYSIWYG Editor that allows you to add MyBookTable shortcodes to your site with just a couple of clicks.<\/p>\n<h4>Built-in Breadcrumbs<\/h4>\n<p>We have added breadcrumbs, which will not only make your book pages easier to use for your visitors, but will also improve search engine optimization. These breadcrumbs are fully compatible with the Genesis or Woo Canvas breadcrumb systems.<\/p>\n<h4>GetNoticed! Theme Integration<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable can import books from Michael Hyatt&#8217;s GetNoticed! theme. MyBookTable and GetNoticed! now work together seamlessly.<\/p>\n<h4>Book Widgets<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable gives you several cool book widgets. Including a featured book widget, genre widget, series widget, and more!<\/p>\n<h4>Premium Features (Available with Paid Upgrade)<\/h4>\n<h4>Affiliate Integration (Professional Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Amazon, BN.com, and CBD.com all offer affiliate programs that help you supplement your income as an author. You won\u2019t have to sell your book out of your garage to make more money. It also integrates seamlessly with leading SEO Plugins like Yoast and Scribe.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate platforms supported:<br \/>\n* Amazon (Amazon, Kindle)<br \/>\n* Commission Junction (Audible)<br \/>\n* Linkshare (Barnes &amp; Noble, Kobo)<\/p>\n<h4>Landing Page Mode (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable 3 can now create landing pages for your books. Landing Page Mode is a total redesign of how a book page looks. It must be seen to be believed. This landing page can be used to power a whole website for your book title or just to make your book pages look better.<\/p>\n<p>= Reading Group Resources Section Pro Upgrade Required)=<br \/>\nMyBookTable Pro now comes with a brand new section where you can add resources for reading clubs and book groups. The more resources you provide book clubs, the more they will want to read your book.<\/p>\n<p>Suggested materials include:<br \/>\n* A PDF Download of Discussion Questions<br \/>\n* Bulk Ordering Link<br \/>\n* Powerpoint Companion<br \/>\n* Chapter Excerpts PDF<br \/>\n* Discussion Video<\/p>\n<h4>Grid View (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Show your books in a responsive grid view.  This is a great option for sites with a lot of books to show.<\/p>\n<h4>Notify Me Button (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>Allow visitors to sign up for book updates by subscribing to your MailChimp list. This button can act as a Pre-Pre-Order button for books that are still a work in process.<\/p>\n<h4>UIEE Book Importer (Pro Upgrade Required)<\/h4>\n<p>MyBookTable can also import books from a Universal Information Exchange Environment (UIEE) file.<\/p>\n",
