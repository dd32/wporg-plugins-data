WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won&#8217;t be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted.<\/p>\n<h4>Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version)<\/h4>\n<p>Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce. Our plugin add&#8217;s these fields \/ attributes for you so you can create a product feed that meets Google&#8217;s requirements. The plugin will add the following product input fields for you: Brand, GTIN, UPC, MPN, EAN, Product condition (New, Refurbished, Used) unit pricing measure, unit pricing base measure, installment and an Optimised title field.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance based<\/h4>\n<p>Only add products to your feed that had sales before in a given time-range. This will make your campaigns more profitable.<\/p>\n<h4>Custom Fields<\/h4>\n<p>Add custom fields with naming you require and fill it with static or dynamic values to your product feed.<\/p>\n<h4>Static field values<\/h4>\n<p>Add static field values to your product feed when needed.<\/p>\n<h4>Category \/ taxonomy mapping<\/h4>\n<p>Some marketing channels require you to map your categories to theirs (such as Google Shopping). This plugin enables you to exactly do that. Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a channel-category based on product names.<\/p>\n<h4>Google Shopping<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for Google Shopping. Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google&#8217;s Merchant center. Also, because of a WooCommerce bug in the structured data of variable products all of these products would normally be disapproved in Google&#8217;s merchant center.

For example: exclude low-margin products, exclude products that are low on stock or only include products that are on sale. You name it, any filter or rule is possible!<\/p>\n<h4>Field \/ attribute selection<\/h4>\n<p>Determine yourself what attributes to in- or exclude in your product feed. This plugin supports usage of ALL attribute types: Custom Attributes, Dynamic Attributes and Product Attributes. Rule-of-thumb: the more attributes you put in your product feed, the better change you have of getting good listings on the channels of your choice.<\/p>\n<h4>Field \/ attribute mapping<\/h4>\n<p>Map your field attributes to those of the channels of your choice.

WooCommerce adds the price of the cheapest variable product in the structured data for all variations of a product. Because of this there will be a mismatch between the product price you provide to Google in your Google Shopping product feed and the structured data price on the product landingpage. Google will therefor disapprove the product in its merchant center. You won&#8217;t be able to advertise on that product in your Google Shopping campaign. Our plugin has a feature that will fix the structured data on variable product pages by adding the correct variable product price in the JSON-LD structured data so Google will approve the variable products you submitted.<\/p>\n<h4>Add critical Google Shopping Feed fields to your store (Elite version)<\/h4>\n<p>Google requires you to add certain fields to the feed you create for Google Shopping. However not all of the required fields are present in WooCommerce. Our plugin add&#8217;s these fields \/ attributes for you so you can create a product feed that meets Google&#8217;s requirements. The plugin will add the following product input fields for you: Brand, GTIN, UPC, MPN, EAN, Product condition (New, Refurbished, Used) unit pricing measure, unit pricing base measure, installment and an Optimised title field.<\/p>\n<h4>Performance based<\/h4>\n<p>Only add products to your feed that had sales before in a given time-range. This will make your campaigns more profitable.<\/p>\n<h4>Custom Fields<\/h4>\n<p>Add custom fields with naming you require and fill it with static or dynamic values to your product feed.<\/p>\n<h4>Static field values<\/h4>\n<p>Add static field values to your product feed when needed.<\/p>\n<h4>Category \/ taxonomy mapping<\/h4>\n<p>Some marketing channels require you to map your categories to theirs (such as Google Shopping). This plugin enables you to exactly do that. Not only does it support 1-to-1 category mapping but you can also map subsets of products on a channel-category based on product names.<\/p>\n<h4>Google Shopping<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for Google Shopping. Feeds created by our plugin have a high approval rate on products in Google&#8217;s Merchant center. Also, because of a WooCommerce bug in the structured data of variable products all of these products would normally be disapproved in Google&#8217;s merchant center. Our plugin fixes this bug and enables you to advertise on all of your products in Google Shopping.<\/p>\n<h4>Meta \/ Facebook Feed\/Catalog and remarketing<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin offers added and advanced features for creating the best possible product feed for your Meta, Facebook catalog and Facebook shop.
