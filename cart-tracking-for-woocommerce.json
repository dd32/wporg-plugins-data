Please check your site admin email inbox for instructions.\" message when the Cart Tracking Menu item is clicked. Furthermore, the plugin cannot be rolled back to the last \"working\" version (1.0.7.), as it does not appear to be tagged on SVN. It appears that cart events are still being recorded in the DB and that the table has not been dropped (so old cart events still appear to be available). Although this last sentence makes me more hopeful that this was not an intentional action by the author, I would not recommend downloading or installing the plugin at all at this point in time. It does not appear to serve any purpose, while still bulking up your site with Freemiums code.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nReporting this violation to the plugins team and leaving this review for public accountability.\nNot only does the plugin not ask permission to phone home (via Freemiums) on installation. It also makes an external API call even after permission is EXPRESSLY DENIED.\n\nIncluding Freemiums for such limited functionality is ridiculous anyway (and takes up an unnecessary chunk of your Inode and storage limits on your hosting account), but I would not have left a one star review for that alone.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
