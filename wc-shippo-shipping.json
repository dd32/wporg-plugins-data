We wanted to love this plugin but have been sorely disappointed. \n\nThis plugin was developed without an understanding of modern ecommerce shipping and the design flaws likely apply to all of 1TeamSoftware's shipping plugins.\n\nThere is very little documentation to guide set up which would be fine if the plugin was well designed but it's not. After much back and forth, we got everything properly set up but we started getting complaints from customers that they were getting ridiculous shipping prices at checkout. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t happening on every order so it took a bit to understand the issue. At times the plugin was selecting a flat rate box when a traditional parcel would provide better pricing and vice versa, selecting a traditional parcel when a flat rate box would provide better pricing. On many orders these discrepancies went unnoticed but in certain scenarios the difference is huge. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have those customers that complained and I was able to accommodate manually but I know that for every customer that took the time to complain there were others who walked away to purchase elsewhere.\n\nWhen we raised this issue with 1TeamSoftware, they confirmed that it is not a bug, just poorly designed and gave us the option to sponsor redesigning their program for them. After recovering from such a ridiculous suggestion we provided evidence of how a competitor plugin properly handles flat rate boxes in parallel (providing the flat rate box option in addition to a regular parcel) which is the natural solution when the goal is to provide the customer with the best shipping options. \n\nWe also reached out to Shippo in an attempt to better understand the issue and have learned that they (Shippo) do not support live rates. 1TeamSoftware's method for returning Shippo \"live\" rates appears to be an unconventional use of Shippo's services, so that raised a concern for us as well.\n\nThroughout the correspondence with 1TeamSoftware they repeatedly said they were confident there was a work around to solve the issue. After much back and forth, it turns out their work around is that we should not offer our customers flat rate boxes. \n\nIn today\u2019s market, providing shoppers with the best shipping rates is essential to staying competitive. In modern e-commerce, the smallest box is not always the least expensive shipping option but 1TeamSoftware is committed to riding this strategy off the cliff. <strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fully Featured &amp; Free.
