        "faq": "<p>Why is this plugin required?<\/p>\n<p>One of the design features of BuddyPress is that only people with administration capabilities can manage BuddyPress features such as groups or users.<br \/>\nThis gives site admin a bit of a headache, considering the power of the admin user, compared to the simple BP tasks they may want a member to do.<br \/>\nTo help with this, we have created this plugin to allow any user with any role to be assigned as a manager of a specific BuddyPress feature.<\/p>\n<p>How does this plugin work?<\/p>\n<p>This plugin assigns the ability to manage, for example, BP Groups, to any other role, even one you created using a user role editor.<br \/>\nAny user assigned that role will then be able to manage that specific BP feature.<\/p>\n",
