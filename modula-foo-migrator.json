        "description": "<p>Easily migrate your galleries from FooGallery to Modula, a customizable WordPress gallery plugin that\u2019s responsive and doesn\u2019t require any coding skills. We provide an importing tool that\u2019s really great for moving your galleries to Modula without jumping through hoops.<\/p>\n<h3>Why migrate from FooGallery to Modula?<\/h3>\n<p>While FooGallery provides more features based on templates, Modula allows you to fully control your galleries. So, if you want to create more galleries in different styles (various animations and effects), you might find yourself quite limited when using FooGallery.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for you, Modula provides a lot of customization options &#8211; 4 different grid types (creative, custom, slider, and masonry), 48 hover effects, animations, thumbnails, 4 image loading effects, filterable galleries, and a beautiful Lightbox powered by Facybox. But that\u2019s not all. With Modula, you get a modern solution for your galleries that will impress your potential clients.<\/p>\n<p>Not all heroes wear capes, and not all plugins are a good fit for everyone. But Modula surely is. You also get album creation, video integration, custom links, captions, watermarking, right-click protection, password protection, EXIF integrations, pagination, user roles, social sharing buttons, enable downloading, and more!<\/p>\n<p>You get the picture: Modula helps you reach the sky! Let\u2019s see some examples of galleries and portfolios that our community has built:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real Estate<\/li>\n<li>Adventure<\/li>\n<li>Travel<\/li>\n<li>Food<\/li>\n<li>Restaurants<\/li>\n<li>Interior and exterior design<\/li>\n<li>Commercial<\/li>\n<li>Lifestyle<\/li>\n<li>Art<\/li>\n<li>Centers, projects, and workshops presentations<\/li>\n<li>Weddings<\/li>\n<li>Events<\/li>\n<li>Illlustration and design<\/li>\n<li>Bands<\/li>\n<li>Boudoir<\/li>\n<li>Black and White<\/li>\n<li>Animals<\/li>\n<li>Macro<\/li>\n<li>Landscapes<\/li>\n<li>Portraits<\/li>\n<li>Motion<\/li>\n<li>Family<\/li>\n<li>Personal Branding<\/li>\n<li>Fashion<\/li>\n<li>And they never stop!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Amazing, right?! And these are only a few examples. You can build whatever your business needs with Modula. Moreover, we can offer you CSS codes and customization that we\u2019ve been collecting for years. You can find everything you need in our documentation or contact our support team, which is always happy to help.<\/p>\n<h3>Which parts of my FooGallery will automatically import to Modula?<\/h3>\n<p>Our Import tool migrates most features from the core FooGallery plugin. We import the following customization from FooGallery:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gallery title<\/li>\n<li>Image title<\/li>\n<li>Image caption<\/li>\n<li>Image alt text<\/li>\n<li>Image URL<\/li>\n<li>Target<\/li>\n<li>Grid type and settings associations between Modula and FooGallery<\/li>\n<li>Image size<\/li>\n<li>Gutter<\/li>\n<li>Lazy load<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Grid type<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the grid type you use in FooGallery, we associate it with what we have. Here we also include the slider and single thumbnail view (max image count is set, and 1 single thumbnail appears). When clicking on the thumbnail, you can go through the whole gallery in the Lightbox.<\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks<\/h3>\n<p>We also replace your shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks from pages and posts (your FooGallery shortcodes will be changed to Modula shortcodes).<\/p>\n",

It's slow, buggy, has a back-end UI that tries to manipulate WP's GUI, and (my personal favorite), a penchant for overriding .PHP styles on updates, breaking site stylings.\n\nAt any rate, I found Modula a few years back and after a few updates from them which have improved the compatibility with thumbnail plugins, it's as good as I could ask for. However, some of my legacy sites have been stuck on FooGallery for years now, and I've wanted to solve that for a while.\n\nThankfully, this plugin has finally fixed that. It does what it claims on the tin in a matter of clicks, and it'll also clear the FooGallery entries too to clean everything up.\n\nI don't know how many people made the error of building around FooGallery, but for the few that have, this is a godsend. Five big honkin' stars.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
