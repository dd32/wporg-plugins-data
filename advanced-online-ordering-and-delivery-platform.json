When I get an order it prints out on printer or printers of my choice.  I make a change on my Clover Pro it changes on my wordpress website.  And the menu that my clients use is the most professional menu that any service or any platform has ever offered me.  And there are many ways in which to control your inventory and I can add delivery charges by distance and other ways as well.  I was even able to use small icons to show if food was spicy, vegetarian etc. to my menu. I used to use another option that clover had which has been around a long time and they are no match against this plugin it's like trying to compare and egg to a grapefruit.  I been in the food industry for over 40 years and I highly recommend this plugin.  One very important thing that should not be ignored and that was when I sent them an email for help.  Someone contacted within 30 minutes, and they were willing and able to get me squared away including offering me free hosting for an entire year. AMAZING !!!!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
