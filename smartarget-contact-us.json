While in Chat the customer might leave the website before you replied, with WhatsApp you can be sure that the customer will always get your messages directly to his WhatsApp on mobile device or computer.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you might need several hours to get to customers, with a regular chat plugin you will end up sending the customer an email which is a completely different communication. Using WhatsApp is simply the most efficient way to increase your chance to convert users to paid customers.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fcHnN23Pdcc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<h3>\ud83d\udcbcHow does WhatsApp by Smartarget work?<\/h3>\n<p>On Mobile &#8211; When a user clicks on the WhatsApp button, the official WhatsApp will be open right away and the user can start talking with you.<\/p>\n<p>On Desktop &#8211; When a user clicks on the Whatsapp button, the official WhatsApp website will be open.

It makes your customers like you more \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h3>Why you should not use Instant messaging over Chat on your website<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Always available &#8211; When customers contact you via instant messaging chat you can always get back to them and be sure that they will get your reply. This is not the case with regular chat plugins because if you didn&#8217;t answer a customer almost right away &#8211; you lost a customer.<\/li>\n<li>Better personalization &#8211; For using instant messaging chats, your customers must have an online profile which can already tell you their name, it\u2019s a nice advantage over a chat because you can approach them personally. If you provide services to countries around the world, you can already know the customers\u2019 country when they contact you via Whatsapp chat, Viber, Facebook Mesenger, Telegra, Line, Skype and more.<\/li>\n<li>No signup, No blockers &#8211; Chatt plugins ask your customer for their email and name because they know that you\u2019re not always available so the cha apps wants to allow you to get back to your customers. But very often the customers don\u2019t want to leave their email address and name, they just want to chat with you and ask their questions. The outcome of it is that they don\u2019t leave their email and leave your website. With instant messaging they don\u2019t need to leave any information, they simply click on the relevant instant messaging platform they prefer and start chatting with you. That simple!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Design your chat button to fit your website style<\/h3>\n<p>Smartarget offers different types of chat buttons: Whatsapp chat button, WeChat button, telegam button, click to call button, Facebook Messenger button, Viber chat button and many more.<\/p>\n<p>All our buttons are fully customized so you can fit the button color and style to your website branding. The button can be located in different positions on your website, for example you can locate it on computer screens in one position and the button on mobile would be located in another position. It\u2019s clear that computer and mobile screens are not the same, that\u2019s why we allow you to have different chat botton position on different platforms.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to choosing the buttom position, you can also choose the shape. Our chat plugin allows you to have a rounded circle chat button or rectangle button with rounded corner. You can also choose if your chet button will include call to action text or not.<\/p>\n<h3>\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Smartarget offers 3 Types of Popup apps<\/h3>\n<p>Smartarget offers different types of Popups, they\u2019re super simple to configure an you don\u2019t need any technical knowledge for it.<\/p>\n<h3>Popup &#8211; Keep It Simple Stupid<\/h3>\n<p>Our first type of Popup will simply be shown when a user enters your website and it will pop on any page.

While in Chat the customer might leave the website before you replied, with WhatsApp you can be sure that the customer will always get your messages directly to his WhatsApp on mobile device or computer.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you might need several hours to get to customers, with a regular chat plugin you will end up sending the customer an email which is a completely different communication. Using WhatsApp is simply the most efficient way to increase your chance to convert users to paid customers.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fcHnN23Pdcc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<h3>\ud83d\udcbcHow does WhatsApp by Smartarget work?<\/h3>\n<p>On Mobile &#8211; When a user clicks on the WhatsApp button, the official WhatsApp will be open right away and the user can start talking with you.<\/p>\n<p>On Desktop &#8211; When a user clicks on the Whatsapp button, the official WhatsApp website will be open. If the User has the WhatsApp software installed on their computer, it will open it. Otherwise Whatsapp will offer the user to install the software or to use the WhatsApp Web interface.<\/p>\n<h3>\ud83d\udd27What features are available with our Whatsapp chat plugin?<\/h3>\n<p>On every page on your website you will have the WhatsApp icon, we offer multiple templates that include different WhatsApp icons and shapes, positions and more.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the features that we offer in our Whatsapp chat plugin:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show one or multiple Whatsapp agents. In case you have multiple contacts like Technical Support, Billing, etc. You can allow your customers to choose which Whatsapp contact is the most relevant.<\/li>\n<li>Whatsapp Contact Us can include up to 5 different WhatsApp numbers<\/li>\n<li>Call to action &#8211; You can set a call to action with your Whatsapp button, if you don\u2019t want to then you can just hide it.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the right position on computer and mobile devices &#8211; It\u2019s clear that your website might not look the same on all types of devices, but with our Whatsapp chat for WordPress, you can choose the position for desktop devices and mobile devices. You can also choose to hide the Whatsapp chat button from one of the types of devices.<\/li>\n<li>Wave animation &#8211; Enable waves animation for whatapp button<\/li>\n<li>Shake animation &#8211; Enable shake animation for Whatsapp icon<\/li>\n<li>Avatars &#8211; Set avatars for each WhatsApp agent to represent them to the customers.

Why? Because Whatsapp Business offers many features that make it easier. For example you can have quick messages that you can predefine. In addition, you can have automatic messages and working hours so customers who wrote to you over the chat, will be able to see if they can expect to get an answer now or later.<\/p>\n<h3>Live Demo of WhatsApp chat plugin for WordPress<\/h3>\n<p>Our plugin is the only one you need, but just to give you more confidence, you can simply check our demo page to see exactly how the Whatsapp chat will look on your WordPress website.

It makes your customers like you more \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h3>Why you should not use Instant messaging over Chat on your website<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Always available &#8211; When customers contact you via instant messaging chat you can always get back to them and be sure that they will get your reply. This is not the case with regular chat plugins because if you didn&#8217;t answer a customer almost right away &#8211; you lost a customer.<\/li>\n<li>Better personalization &#8211; For using instant messaging chats, your customers must have an online profile which can already tell you their name, it\u2019s a nice advantage over a chat because you can approach them personally. If you provide services to countries around the world, you can already know the customers\u2019 country when they contact you via Whatsapp chat, Viber, Facebook Mesenger, Telegra, Line, Skype and more.<\/li>\n<li>No signup, No blockers &#8211; Chatt plugins ask your customer for their email and name because they know that you\u2019re not always available so the cha apps wants to allow you to get back to your customers. But very often the customers don\u2019t want to leave their email address and name, they just want to chat with you and ask their questions. The outcome of it is that they don\u2019t leave their email and leave your website. With instant messaging they don\u2019t need to leave any information, they simply click on the relevant instant messaging platform they prefer and start chatting with you. That simple!!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Design your chat button to fit your website style<\/h3>\n<p>Smartarget offers different types of chat buttons: Whatsapp chat button, WeChat button, telegam button, click to call button, Facebook Messenger button, Viber chat button and many more.<\/p>\n<p>All our buttons are fully customized so you can fit the button color and style to your website branding.
