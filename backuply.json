I had been using UpdraftPlus Backup which is a good plugin, but Backuply provides more features at a better price. The cloud destination is a nice plus and the ability to migrate or clone to another domain works flawlessly. It really is a great solution. Just give it a try, the free version has more than enough features to test it out. If you need more, go with Pro.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div
