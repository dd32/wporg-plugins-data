The plugin does not import unconverted spreadsheets. An example file is delivered with the plugin. <\/li>\n<li>Your paid SpreadsheetConverter license must be for <strong>the Professional Edition<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>You must use the same major version of the plugin as your SpreadsheetConverter license is for.<\/li>\n<li>A WordPress server that allows you to install plugins and use iframes. If you use WordPress.com or other hosted environments that limit this, it&#8217;s usually just as easy to use <a href=\"https:\/\/help.spreadsheetconverter.com\/support\/online-help\/publish-to-cloud\" title=\"Link to the Publish to Cloud help page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Publish to Cloud<\/a> instead.<\/li>\n<li>Your WordPress server must be running <strong>version 4.5 or later of WordPress<\/strong>.

The SSC Calculator file contains everything that WordPress needs to run the calculator.<\/p>\n<h4>Uploading a new calculator<\/h4>\n<p>Follow these instructions only when you upload a new calculator for the first time. If you later want to update an existing calculator that you have already uploaded at least once to WordPress, there are separate instructions below.<\/p>\n<h4>Creating the SSC Calculator file<\/h4>\n<p>With the plugin, you get two example files, one that you will use for this initial upload and one for the update described below.<\/p>\n<h4>Uploading the SSC Calculator file<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>In WordPress, locate the <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong> link in your WordPress menu. If you don&#8217;t see this link, please verify that you have installed the plugin correctly according to the instructions above.<\/li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong>, then <strong>Add New<\/strong> if you are about to upload a new calculator that you haven&#8217;t uploaded before. <\/li>\n<li>Enter a unique, descriptive name for this particular calculator in the <strong>Enter calculator name<\/strong> field. For the example file, you can use <strong>Weekly Time Card<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Choose Package<\/strong> and select the SSC Calculator file.

Locate the <strong>weekly-time-card.zip<\/strong>\u00a0file, select it and press <strong>Open<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Publish<\/strong> button and the SSC Calculator file will be uploaded to WordPress. It will not be visible in any post or page until you embed it (read more below).\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Embedding instructions<\/h3>\n<p>Before you embed a spreadsheet, you must follow the steps above to upload the SSC Calculator file to WordPress. Now, it&#8217;s time to embed the calculator in one or more web pages.<\/p>\n<h4>Using the Block editor<\/h4>\n<p>To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Block editor:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In WordPress, click on the <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong> link in the menu.<\/li>\n<li>In the list of calculators, locate the calculator you want to embed. <\/li>\n<li>In the column <strong>Calculator iframe<\/strong>, click on the <strong>Click to Copy<\/strong> button for the calculator you want to embed. This copies the complete embed code to the clipboard.<\/li>\n<li>Open the Block editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the plus sign to insert a new block. Type &#8220;html&#8221; in the search box and select to insert a <strong>Custom HTML<\/strong> block. <\/li>\n<li>Move the Custom HTML block to the correct position on the page, either by dragging it or using the up\/down arrows.<\/li>\n<li>Select the <strong>HTML<\/strong> view for the Custom HTML block.<\/li>\n<li>Paste the embed code HTML into the Custom HTML block with Ctrl+V or right mouseclick+Paste.<\/li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Preview<\/strong> view for the block. <\/li>\n<li>If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there&#8217;s too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. Select the <strong>HTML<\/strong> view for the Custom HTML block, adjust the <strong>height<\/strong> and <strong>width<\/strong> parameters in the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the <strong>Preview<\/strong> tab until the calculator looks good. Don&#8217;t be afraid of leaving a considerable margin\u00a0around the calculator.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to use an uploaded calculator on more than one page, just repeat the above once for every page where you want it to appear. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Using the Classic editor<\/h4>\n<p>To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Classic editor:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Classic editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.<\/li>\n<li>Place the cursor at the right spot and click <strong>Embed SSC Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>In the list called <strong>Calculator Link<\/strong>, scroll to and select the calculator you want to embed.<\/li>\n<li>If necessary, modify the size of the calculator frame in the web page using the fields <strong>Iframe\u00a0Width<\/strong>\u00a0and <strong>Iframe Height<\/strong>.\u00a0Click <strong>Insert Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t see the calculator, only a set of HTML tags, click on the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab for a preview of the page.<\/li>\n<li>If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there&#8217;s too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. On the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab, drag the handle to resize the calculator frame. For better control, switch to the <strong>Text<\/strong> tab, adjust the <strong>height<\/strong> and <strong>width<\/strong> parameters in the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab until the calculator looks good.

The new version is uploaded and automatically used instead of the old one, in all pages and posts that you have already embedded it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Caching may delay updates to your web pages<\/h4>\n<p>If an update to a calculator does not immediately appear on the web or in the preview in the plugin, it may be a result of caching, which is beyond our control. Caching typically introduces a delay of 1-48 hours in the publishing of new or updated web content. When you test static web content like uploaded calculators, you can try adding a fake \u201cversion\u201d parameter to the link to the calculator:<\/p>\n<pre><code>https:\/\/example.com\/calculator.html?version=1\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>When you update the calculator, just remember to change also the version number in the links to it, which should force the cache to fetch the updated content. Note: you only need the <em>version<\/em> parameter during testing, to verify that the update went through correctly. In your production environment, the updated version will be loaded slightly later as the cached copies of the previous version expire.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A full online help for the plugin is available <a href=\"http:\/\/help.spreadsheetconverter.com\/support\/online-help\/help-wordpress-plugin-to-import-spreadsheets-from-microsoft-excel\" title=\"Link to the SpreadsheetConverter online help for the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on the SpreadsheetConverter website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Deletion instructions<\/h3>\n<h4>Using the Block editor<\/h4>\n<p>To remove a\u00a0calculator\u00a0that you previously embedded in page or post:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the Custom HTML block that contains the embed code for the calculator.<\/li>\n<li>Open the block menu for the block and select <strong>Remove Block<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Using the Classic editor<\/h4>\n<p>To remove a\u00a0calculator\u00a0that you previously embedded in page or post:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Switch to the <strong>Text<\/strong> mode.<\/li>\n<li>Remove the entire &#8220;hasIframe&#8221; table, from the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> statement to the <strong>\/table<\/strong> statement.<\/li>\n<li>Switch to the <strong>Visual<\/strong> mode to verify the result.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A full online help for the plugin is available <a href=\"http:\/\/help.spreadsheetconverter.com\/support\/online-help\/help-wordpress-plugin-to-import-spreadsheets-from-microsoft-excel\" title=\"Link to the SpreadsheetConverter online help for the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on the SpreadsheetConverter website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>I want to test this with my own spreadsheets!<\/h3>\n<p>To test the plugin with your own spreadsheets, you need to download the SpreadsheetConverter add-in for Excel and install it in your system.

Or, they'll provide generic feedback for some unrelated problem.\n\nWhile the result is cool when it works, I invested SEVERAL hours building Excel templates and working with both of their plugins to make it work.

The SSC Calculator file contains everything that WordPress needs to run the calculator.<\/p>\n<h4>Uploading a new calculator<\/h4>\n<p>Follow these instructions only when you upload a new calculator for the first time. If you later want to update an existing calculator that you have already uploaded at least once to WordPress, there are separate instructions below.<\/p>\n<h4>Creating the SSC Calculator file<\/h4>\n<p>With the plugin, you get two example files, one that you will use for this initial upload and one for the update described below.<\/p>\n<h4>Uploading the SSC Calculator file<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>In WordPress, locate the <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong> link in your WordPress menu. If you don&#8217;t see this link, please verify that you have installed the plugin correctly according to the instructions above.<\/li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong>, then <strong>Add New<\/strong> if you are about to upload a new calculator that you haven&#8217;t uploaded before. <\/li>\n<li>Enter a unique, descriptive name for this particular calculator in the <strong>Enter calculator name<\/strong> field. For the example file, you can use <strong>Weekly Time Card<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Choose Package<\/strong> and select the SSC Calculator file. The example file provided with the plugin is in the <strong>examples &gt; 1-upload<\/strong> folder of the plugin ZIP. Locate the <strong>weekly-time-card.zip<\/strong>\u00a0file, select it and press <strong>Open<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Publish<\/strong> button and the SSC Calculator file will be uploaded to WordPress. It will not be visible in any post or page until you embed it (read more below).\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Embedding instructions<\/h3>\n<p>Before you embed a spreadsheet, you must follow the steps above to upload the SSC Calculator file to WordPress. Now, it&#8217;s time to embed the calculator in one or more web pages.<\/p>\n<h4>Using the Block editor<\/h4>\n<p>To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Block editor:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In WordPress, click on the <strong>Upload SSC Calculator<\/strong> link in the menu.<\/li>\n<li>In the list of calculators, locate the calculator you want to embed. <\/li>\n<li>In the column <strong>Calculator iframe<\/strong>, click on the <strong>Click to Copy<\/strong> button for the calculator you want to embed. This copies the complete embed code to the clipboard.<\/li>\n<li>Open the Block editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the plus sign to insert a new block. Type &#8220;html&#8221; in the search box and select to insert a <strong>Custom HTML<\/strong> block. <\/li>\n<li>Move the Custom HTML block to the correct position on the page, either by dragging it or using the up\/down arrows.<\/li>\n<li>Select the <strong>HTML<\/strong> view for the Custom HTML block.<\/li>\n<li>Paste the embed code HTML into the Custom HTML block with Ctrl+V or right mouseclick+Paste.<\/li>\n<li>Select the <strong>Preview<\/strong> view for the block. <\/li>\n<li>If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there&#8217;s too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. Select the <strong>HTML<\/strong> view for the Custom HTML block, adjust the <strong>height<\/strong> and <strong>width<\/strong> parameters in the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the <strong>Preview<\/strong> tab until the calculator looks good. Don&#8217;t be afraid of leaving a considerable margin\u00a0around the calculator.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to use an uploaded calculator on more than one page, just repeat the above once for every page where you want it to appear. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Using the Classic editor<\/h4>\n<p>To insert a converted spreadsheet in WordPress using the Classic editor:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Classic editor for the page or post where you want the uploaded calculator to appear.<\/li>\n<li>Place the cursor at the right spot and click <strong>Embed SSC Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>In the list called <strong>Calculator Link<\/strong>, scroll to and select the calculator you want to embed.<\/li>\n<li>If necessary, modify the size of the calculator frame in the web page using the fields <strong>Iframe\u00a0Width<\/strong>\u00a0and <strong>Iframe Height<\/strong>.\u00a0Click <strong>Insert Calculator<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t see the calculator, only a set of HTML tags, click on the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab for a preview of the page.<\/li>\n<li>If you cannot see the entire calculator, or if scrollbars appear, or if there&#8217;s too much whitespace around the calculator, you may need to adjust the size of the iframe. On the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab, drag the handle to resize the calculator frame. For better control, switch to the <strong>Text<\/strong> tab, adjust the <strong>height<\/strong> and <strong>width<\/strong> parameters in the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> tag that represents the calculator, switching back and forth to the <strong>Visual<\/strong> tab until the calculator looks good.

The new version is uploaded and automatically used instead of the old one, in all pages and posts that you have already embedded it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Caching may delay updates to your web pages<\/h4>\n<p>If an update to a calculator does not immediately appear on the web or in the preview in the plugin, it may be a result of caching, which is beyond our control. Caching typically introduces a delay of 1-48 hours in the publishing of new or updated web content. When you test static web content like uploaded calculators, you can try adding a fake \u201cversion\u201d parameter to the link to the calculator:<\/p>\n<pre><code>https:\/\/example.com\/calculator.html?version=1\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>When you update the calculator, just remember to change also the version number in the links to it, which should force the cache to fetch the updated content. Note: you only need the <em>version<\/em> parameter during testing, to verify that the update went through correctly. In your production environment, the updated version will be loaded slightly later as the cached copies of the previous version expire.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>A full online help for the plugin is available <a href=\"http:\/\/help.spreadsheetconverter.com\/support\/online-help\/help-wordpress-plugin-to-import-spreadsheets-from-microsoft-excel\" title=\"Link to the SpreadsheetConverter online help for the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on the SpreadsheetConverter website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Deletion instructions<\/h3>\n<h4>Using the Block editor<\/h4>\n<p>To remove a\u00a0calculator\u00a0that you previously embedded in page or post:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the Custom HTML block that contains the embed code for the calculator.<\/li>\n<li>Open the block menu for the block and select <strong>Remove Block<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Using the Classic editor<\/h4>\n<p>To remove a\u00a0calculator\u00a0that you previously embedded in page or post:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Switch to the <strong>Text<\/strong> mode.<\/li>\n<li>Remove the entire &#8220;hasIframe&#8221; table, from the <strong>table id=&#8221;hasIframe&#8221;<\/strong> statement to the <strong>\/table<\/strong> statement.<\/li>\n<li>Switch to the <strong>Visual<\/strong> mode to verify the result.<\/li>\n<li>Save your changes by clicking <strong>Publish<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A full online help for the plugin is available <a href=\"http:\/\/help.spreadsheetconverter.com\/support\/online-help\/help-wordpress-plugin-to-import-spreadsheets-from-microsoft-excel\" title=\"Link to the SpreadsheetConverter online help for the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on the SpreadsheetConverter website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>I want to test this with my own spreadsheets!<\/h3>\n<p>To test the plugin with your own spreadsheets, you need to download the SpreadsheetConverter add-in for Excel and install it in your system.

        "10.1": "<p>Starting with version 10.1 we support the  Gutenberg Block editor in both WordPress version 4 and 5, with seamless switching to\/from the Classic editor. Unfortunately, we have identified <strong>a major issue with the Classic editor in Google Chrome<\/strong>. We don&#039;t know why this problem occurs or how to avoid it. We will continue to investigate this, but we urgently need to release a version of this plugin that is compatible with WordPress 5 and we believe that most users will be unaffected by the problem anyhow.<\/p>\n\n<p>The problem we have seen during testing with Google Chrome version 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit) is that an embedded calculator may disappear from the page\/post that is being edited.<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In the Classic editor, the embedded calculator may be lost when you switch between the Visual and Text editing modes.<\/li>\n<li>In the Classic editor, the embedded calculator may be lost when you are in the Visual mode, then click on the calculator iframe, then click outside the iframe.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>If you are affected by the issue, you will suddenly notice that the embedded calculator no longer appears in the page or post. The converted spreadsheet is still securely saved as a calculating web page in your WordPress environment and continues to work fine in all other places where you have embedded it. The only thing you have to do if this happens to you is to switch to the Block editor and simply insert the embed code again.<\/p>\n\n<p>Please note that you will be completely unaffected by this issue<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if you don&#039;t use Google Chrome,<\/li>\n<li>if you do use Google Chrome but never fall back to the old Classic editor, <\/li>\n<li>if you use the Classic editor in Google Chrome but don&#039;t perform any of the actions that are known to make calculators disappear. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Please use whatever circumvention you find best for you until we hopefully resolve this issue.<\/p>",
