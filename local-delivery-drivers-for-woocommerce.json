It helps you track which driver is handling which deliveries.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;Failed Delivery Attempt&#8221; &#8211; If a delivery driver tries to deliver an order but is unable to (e.g. the customer is not home or the delivery address is incorrect), this status records the failed attempt. It helps you track any issues that may have occurred during the delivery process and communicate with customers about when to expect a second attempt.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;Out for Delivery&#8221; &#8211; This status shows that the delivery driver is in the process of delivering the order. In addition, it indicates that the shipment is on its way to the customer and is expected to arrive soon.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>ASSIGNING DELIVERY DRIVERS TO ORDERS<\/h3>\n<p>The store owner has the ability to assign delivery drivers to orders on the admin panel&#8217;s order page.<\/p>\n<p>Once a delivery driver is assigned to an order, the order&#8217;s status will be updated to &#8216;Driver assigned.<\/p>\n<h3>ORDERS NOTES<\/h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce&#8221; plugin saves all actions the delivery driver takes on the order notes.<\/p>\n<p>This allows you to track the progress of each delivery and see any comments or updates made by the driver.<\/p>\n<p>By keeping a record of all delivery-related activities on the order notes, you can improve communication and transparency within your team, ultimately leading to more efficient and successful deliveries.<\/p>\n<h3>DELIVERY DRIVERS MOBILE-FRIENDLY PANEL<\/h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce&#8221; plugin includes a mobile-friendly panel that allows delivery drivers to manage their deliveries from their smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>The panel has a convenient, app-like interface and can be added to the mobile homepage for easy access.<\/p>\n<p>The delivery drivers panel includes screens for each order status, including a dashboard, driver assigned orders, out for delivery, failed delivery, and delivered orders.<\/p>\n<p>On the dashboard, drivers can update their availability and view the total number of orders in each status.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;driver assigned&#8221; screen shows all orders assigned to the driver, while the &#8220;out for delivery&#8221; screen displays all orders on the current delivery route.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;failed delivery&#8221; and &#8220;delivered&#8221; screens allow drivers to view their completed orders from today, yesterday, this month, and last month.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the delivery drivers panel provides an easy-to-use interface for managing deliveries on the go.<\/p>\n<h3>ORDER PAGE SCREEN<\/h3>\n<p>On the order page, delivery drivers can view all the relevant details for an order, such as the billing and shipping addresses, items included in the order, and any comments left by the customer or dispatch center.<\/p>\n<p>They can also easily update the order&#8217;s status to &#8220;delivered&#8221; or &#8220;failed attempt&#8221; and leave comments for other team members to see.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the delivery driver can quickly call the customer or dispatch center directly from the order page if needed.<\/p>\n<h3>Supported languages<\/h3>\n<p>English, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Portuguese, Russian, German, Italian, and Arabic.<\/p>\n<h3>* PREMIUM FEATURES<\/h3>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/powerfulwp.com\/local-delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce-premium\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce Premium<\/a> plugin.<br \/>\nThe premium plugin includes the following additional features:<\/p>\n<h3>DELIVERY TRACKING.<\/h3>\n<p>Provide your customers with the ability to track their deliveries by giving them access to a map showing their home address, store address, and the delivery driver&#8217;s location.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, let them know the estimated time of arrival and give them the option to view the driver&#8217;s image, name, and vehicle details.<\/p>\n<p>They can even call the driver directly if needed.<\/p>\n<h3>FULLY ADMIN DRIVERS DASHBOARD.<\/h3>\n<p>The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your drivers and orders, including the number of orders each driver has in different statuses, the number of orders without an assigned driver, and the number of orders ready to be claimed.<\/p>\n<p>The statuses list displays all active drivers, their availability, and claim permissions.<\/p>\n<p>From the dashboard, store owners can easily update the statuses of all drivers with just one click.<\/p>\n<h3>ADMIN ORDERS FILTERS.<\/h3>\n<p>The store owners can filter orders with or without drivers, specific driver orders, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>MANAGE DRIVERS.<\/h3>\n<p>The store owners can view and manage driver information, account status, work availability, and claim permission on the &#8216;users&#8217;

I run a small online photo framing business and I will do some of the deliveries myself. Having checked out some of the bigger well known brands in the delivery software niche, the that worked best with Woocommerce and for my needs was Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce by far.\n\nAlthough my deliveries are far from local (some will be over 100km away), I was able to tweak the plugin settings and customer emails &amp; SMS messages to work with my delivery workflow. Using custom order status' I am able to send different noiftcations to my customers, for example: an order status of dispatched-post is used when I am sending orders through the post office, and dispatched-local when I am delivering the order myself, each sending a different notification email and\/or SMS to the customer.\n\nOf course, that's only a fraction of the workflow, but Would never have been able to do it without this plugin or paying someone a small fortune to create something custom.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Shopping cart is empty<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/devlins\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/909b814815f8dcef0b43e9c088f83fc8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/909b814815f8dcef0b43e9c088f83fc8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/devlins\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">devlins<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">November 9, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Does anyone know why that is.\nAs soon as I activate the plugin and put a product in the shopping cart, the shopping cart is always empty<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Like it<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/neomie6011\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3078d5f511bfaaa01b698fa41770f24b?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3078d5f511bfaaa01b698fa41770f24b?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/neomie6011\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">neomie6011<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 3, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I like this plugin and I hope it stays updated as needed and continued great support from the developer.

It helps you track which driver is handling which deliveries.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;Failed Delivery Attempt&#8221; &#8211; If a delivery driver tries to deliver an order but is unable to (e.g. the customer is not home or the delivery address is incorrect), this status records the failed attempt. It helps you track any issues that may have occurred during the delivery process and communicate with customers about when to expect a second attempt.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8220;Out for Delivery&#8221; &#8211; This status shows that the delivery driver is in the process of delivering the order. In addition, it indicates that the shipment is on its way to the customer and is expected to arrive soon.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>ASSIGNING DELIVERY DRIVERS TO ORDERS<\/h3>\n<p>The store owner has the ability to assign delivery drivers to orders on the admin panel&#8217;s order page.<\/p>\n<p>Once a delivery driver is assigned to an order, the order&#8217;s status will be updated to &#8216;Driver assigned.<\/p>\n<h3>ORDERS NOTES<\/h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce&#8221; plugin saves all actions the delivery driver takes on the order notes.<\/p>\n<p>This allows you to track the progress of each delivery and see any comments or updates made by the driver.<\/p>\n<p>By keeping a record of all delivery-related activities on the order notes, you can improve communication and transparency within your team, ultimately leading to more efficient and successful deliveries.<\/p>\n<h3>DELIVERY DRIVERS MOBILE-FRIENDLY PANEL<\/h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Local Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce&#8221; plugin includes a mobile-friendly panel that allows delivery drivers to manage their deliveries from their smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>The panel has a convenient, app-like interface and can be added to the mobile homepage for easy access.<\/p>\n<p>The delivery drivers panel includes screens for each order status, including a dashboard, driver assigned orders, out for delivery, failed delivery, and delivered orders.<\/p>\n<p>On the dashboard, drivers can update their availability and view the total number of orders in each status.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;driver assigned&#8221;
