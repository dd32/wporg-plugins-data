The plugin caused a critical error on a main category on our site - and given no support via Awesome Support email nor via WP Forums, I have had to find an another ticketing\/helpdesk option. The free version of the plugin literally caused our main product category, to become a \"critical error\" page instead of showing the range of products in that category. As soon as plugin turned off, category worked as normal. My concern would be this occurring on a larger site than ours (we have only 3 categories so saw this issue easily). If this happened on a larger site you may never notice unless you went through thorough testing into every category and sub-category to check. And we could turn off the plugin, then category worked as normal, turn back on plugin, category kept working, but as soon as you did anything with a ticket, the issue returned to that one specific category in it becoming a \"critical error\" page. I also disabled every setting under the Settings &gt; Product Management section so as to not have syncing of our product range with the plugin, but that didn't help either. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">One other issue with the free version I found was that when a customer put up a post in a helpdesk ticket, upon submitting it and page refresh their comment wasn't appearing for them to see in the ticket.

I was a loyal customer for more than a year and literally bought everything they sell. The product was \"ok\" at best and they were always fairly slow, in my opinion, in tackling bugs and customer support tickets. Our needs changed and we no longer needed internal support so we moved away from the product. Inadvertently we allowed the licenses we had to auto-renew but within a few days we caught it and explained the situation and asked for a refund. Instead of seeing that we made a simple mistake (missed the cancel date by only a few days) and were not using the product any longer (not installed), they refused to give us a refund and kept about $800 in fees. Wow, they must be hurting for cash or just have black hearts to value the money more than the goodwill of an otherwise faithful client. I would not encourage even an enemy to do business with this company. The product is just \"ok\" but the service is terrible. Run and find a better company.

        "": "<p>The version 4.x.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 3.x.x.  It is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage\/test environment before applying it to your production site.\nAt the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!<\/p>\n\n<p>After upgrading please make sure you install the latest version of add-ons as well - especially the Email Support add-on (Version 5.0.x) and Gravity Forms.<\/p>\n\n<p>Automatic upgrades to 4.0.0 are only supported from version 3.3.4. If you are running an earlier version in the 3.x line please make sure you upgrade to 3.3.4 FIRST, verify that all your settings are intact and then install version 4.\nUpgrades from the version 2.x and 1.x lines are NOT supported at all.<\/p>\n\n<p>After upgrading you might notice that menu options under TICKETS are missing or the tabs inside your TICKETS-&gt;SETTINGS screen are missing.  If so, please try any or all of the following:<\/p>\n\n<pre><code>1. Go to TICKETS-&amp;gt;TOOLS-&amp;gt;CLEANUP and find the upgrade button and click that to re-run the upgrade.  This will add required WordPress security capabilities back to the system.\n2. Go to your TICKETS-&amp;gt;SETTINGS screen and click the SAVE button.  This adds the default settings that are new for version 4.0 to your installation.\n3. Deactivate the add-on and re-activate it.  This triggers some housekeeping tasks.\n<\/code><\/pre>"
