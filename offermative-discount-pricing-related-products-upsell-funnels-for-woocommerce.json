Otherwise, profitability  goes down a lot. \nThat's why correctly working Upsells &amp; Cross Sells options with wide settings are very important to me. Also, dynamic pricing options (including the ability to use coupons and free gifts), AB testing and localization (my website is not in English) are very important to me too. \nYou can say that there are many similar plugins. Yes, you will be right (before I used to install several plugins too , which mostly covered my needs). But everyone who creates their own sites strives to install as few plugins as possible, because \"the more different plugins - the more likely they will conflict with each other\".\nUsing the Offermative plugin - you get an great  All-in-one solution with guaranteed compatibility and no problems and errors due to inconsistent code. A special word of thanks to the support team - they are always ready to help with solving problems and are very constructive with suggestions for new functionality :)\nPS And I'm really looking forward to the new feature - showing Upsells &amp; Cross Sells products not only based on the products in the cart, but also based on the previous customer reactions (acceptance or rejection of the previously shown offer).\nSorry for my English - it's not my native language :)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">The only discount plugin you will ever need.<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pragyan1999\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/89026aaf63b67b4ffa4f955a58bc4134?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/89026aaf63b67b4ffa4f955a58bc4134?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pragyan1999\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pragyan1999<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 14, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">To be honest, I have not yet opened my store but I have been looking for a good discount plugin for months now. I have tested a lot of them but was not happy with any of then. Even if some worked they didn't have all the features so I had to install multiple plugins that slowed my website. It was then when I stumbled upon Offermative. Since then I have been testing a lot of its features and I absolutely love them.\nAs the title implies it's an all-in-one plugin; Upsells, Crosells, Coupons, Order Bumps, Dynamic Pricing you name it they have it. The features that I like the most are the AI-automation and the A\/B testing features with great analytics. Once you start using it you will immediately that this plugin is made by some really intelligent peeps with the only objective of converting your website into a money-making machine.\nThere is this thing I wish they should add is customizable checkout and thank you pages with templates like CartFlows. It will also ensure great integration along also help owners with low design skills. \nAnyways great plugin keep up the great work. It feels really good and proud to see such wonderful products coming out of your motherland. All the Best.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Increasing Per-Sale Revenue and Customer Loyalty<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fromtheabbey\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3d455c91afdcbc9f51366ef96c3ea7f9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3d455c91afdcbc9f51366ef96c3ea7f9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/fromtheabbey\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\"> <small>(fromtheabbey)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 8, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I run an online bookstore. This is a market where people tend to search either Amazon or Google for the title they're looking for, make a purchase, and not really care why they bought from. So getting repeat buyers has been a challenge, and that means lower revenue as well.\n\nOffermative gives me a way to make my online store more attractive. By pairing offers with what my customers have in their cart, I can target specific interests. I have noticed an increase in per-sale revenue. That has been the main benefit of using Offermative. I also hope that paired with a loyalty program and email campaigns that I will be able to increase the number of repeat buyers and loyal customers. However, I haven't used Offermative enough yet to know that's true.\n\nOne of the best things about Offermative has been its customer service. I made suggestions for improvement and the developers responded quickly and implemented my suggestions. \n\nOne suggestion I made was the ability to override conditions for an offer that the plugin's AI sets automatically. They recently made that option available.  They are still developing the plugin, so even more improvements are coming. I love the idea of the plugin tracking sales and creating offers based on sales patterns. However, I would still like to see more flexibility in the way of manual overrides. As a seller, I know what my customers may purchase together better than the AI. Let me have the option to create recipes completely manually or to allow the AI to more quickly create them for me.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
