We&#8217;ve followed the same methods as WooCommerce where you simply need to copy the template files into your child theme to start overriding the layouts.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also taking into account page builders and created short codes for all the template parts of the theme. This will allow builders such as Divi, Elementor, WPBakery to be used with CardanoPress.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
