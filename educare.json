If you&#8217;re not a Pro user, those features are off-limits to you.<\/p>\n<p>The premium version of Educare comes with more powerful, user-friendly and useful functionality. Most Important thing is that, now it&#8217;s possible to manage any type of result system in the world using Educare! Let&#8217;s see how it&#8217;s possible &rarr;<\/p>\n<h3>Student Management<\/h3>\n<p>Admin can add single and import unlimited students via Exel file. Once, student details are added then no need to fill student details again while adding or publishing any results. Also, Student can login and access their data. Exp: View results, See attendance, Get notice, Explore old (class) data and much more.<\/p>\n<h3>Results Management<\/h3>\n<p>Educare provide powerful results management functionality. Admin can publish single and import unlimited results via .csv (Excel) files. Educare help to process and automatically calculate the results. When the result is published, the student can view result by roll number, registration number, class, examination or year. Also, student can save or print the results.<\/p>\n<h3>Educare Marksheet Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Using this features admin (teacher) can add subject or class wise multiple student results at a same time. So, it&#8217;s most useful for (single) teacher. There are different teachers for each subject. Teachers can add marks for their specific subject using this feature. After, the mark addition is done for all the subjects, students can view and print their results when admin publish it as results. Also, teacher can print all student marks as a marksheet. (We call it &#8211; THE GOLDEN FEATURES FOR TEACHER!).<\/p>\n<h3>Performance or Promote Students<\/h3>\n<p>Admin or authorized person can conditionally promote or change class, year, group of multiple students with just one click! Most useful when students need to be promoted (from one class to another class) or when multiple students need to be updated. Also, educare help you to apply conditions when promote the students.<\/p>\n<h3>Grading Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Using this feature you (admin or authorized person) can add, modify, manage or automatically calculate any type of result GPA or CGPA based on requirements. E.g. India, Bangladesh, Nigeria or US result GPA (CGPA) and calculation methods\/rules are different. So, maintaining a defined result using one rule is a bit tricky. The result rule feature solves this problem. If you manage results for Indian students, you can add Indian grading system or rules. Also, you can add Bangladesh, Nigeria or US grading system in the same way. Also, Educare support custom add-ons for results system to adjust your results format.<\/p>\n<h3>Office Management<\/h3>\n<p>Admin can add class or group wise subject, ratings scale, exam, session\/year, extra (custom) fields and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Strong Security<\/h3>\n<p>Educare come with powerful and strong security system.

We will take immediate action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Protected Result<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to password or PIN-based authentication systems, the primary goal is to ensure that only specific users with the correct PIN or password can access specific results. By implementing this process, Educare helps protect result information and prevent unauthorized access. Moreover, this feature enables authorities to restrict access for specific or multiple students, such as in cases of non-payment or similar issues, ensuring effective control over students and security.<\/p>\n<h3>Users Roles and Permission &#8211;<\/h3>\n<p>Educare User Roles and Permissions allows the administrator to grant users appropriate access to various functionalities, based on their roles and capabilities.<\/p>\n<h3>User&#8217;s Profile and Dashboard<\/h3>\n<p>Educare provides custom user dashboards for students, parents and teachers.

Most Important thing is that, now it&#8217;s possible to manage any type of result system in the world using Educare! Let&#8217;s see how it&#8217;s possible &rarr;<\/p>\n<h3>Student Management<\/h3>\n<p>Admin can add single and import unlimited students via Exel file. Once, student details are added then no need to fill student details again while adding or publishing any results. Also, Student can login and access their data. Exp: View results, See attendance, Get notice, Explore old (class) data and much more.<\/p>\n<h3>Results Management<\/h3>\n<p>Educare provide powerful results management functionality. Admin can publish single and import unlimited results via .csv (Excel) files. Educare help to process and automatically calculate the results. When the result is published, the student can view result by roll number, registration number, class, examination or year. Also, student can save or print the results.<\/p>\n<h3>Educare Marksheet Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Using this features admin (teacher) can add subject or class wise multiple student results at a same time. So, it&#8217;s most useful for (single) teacher. There are different teachers for each subject. Teachers can add marks for their specific subject using this feature. After, the mark addition is done for all the subjects, students can view and print their results when admin publish it as results. Also, teacher can print all student marks as a marksheet. (We call it &#8211; THE GOLDEN FEATURES FOR TEACHER!).<\/p>\n<h3>Performance or Promote Students<\/h3>\n<p>Admin or authorized person can conditionally promote or change class, year, group of multiple students with just one click! Most useful when students need to be promoted (from one class to another class) or when multiple students need to be updated. Also, educare help you to apply conditions when promote the students.<\/p>\n<h3>Grading Systems<\/h3>\n<p>Using this feature you (admin or authorized person) can add, modify, manage or automatically calculate any type of result GPA or CGPA based on requirements. E.g. India, Bangladesh, Nigeria or US result GPA (CGPA) and calculation methods\/rules are different. So, maintaining a defined result using one rule is a bit tricky. The result rule feature solves this problem. If you manage results for Indian students, you can add Indian grading system or rules. Also, you can add Bangladesh, Nigeria or US grading system in the same way. Also, Educare support custom add-ons for results system to adjust your results format.<\/p>\n<h3>Office Management<\/h3>\n<p>Admin can add class or group wise subject, ratings scale, exam, session\/year, extra (custom) fields and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Strong Security<\/h3>\n<p>Educare come with powerful and strong security system.

By implementing this process, Educare helps protect result information and prevent unauthorized access. Moreover, this feature enables authorities to restrict access for specific or multiple students, such as in cases of non-payment or similar issues, ensuring effective control over students and security.<\/p>\n<h3>Users Roles and Permission &#8211;<\/h3>\n<p>Educare User Roles and Permissions allows the administrator to grant users appropriate access to various functionalities, based on their roles and capabilities.<\/p>\n<h3>User&#8217;s Profile and Dashboard<\/h3>\n<p>Educare provides custom user dashboards for students, parents and teachers.
