Our logs will record the errors and point you to the file that\u2019s causing problems.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll notify you as soon as an error occurs, allowing you to jump on it as soon as possible rather than waiting for a user to report it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/features\/error-logs\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about error logs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Instant Alerts for WordPress Sites<\/h3>\n<p>With Logtivity alerts, you can keep an eye on all your clients\u2019 sites.

You can use these charts to show logins, purchases, subscriptions, cancellations, downloads, or any other key events. If it happens in WordPress site, Logtivity can turn it into a bar chart or a line chart.<\/p>\n<p>You can also customize the date range for charts. Your charts have advanced date ranges, so you can zoom in to view any time period.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/features\/customisable-reporting-dashboard\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about charts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>View Activity Logs Inside WordPress<\/h3>\n<p>Logtivity has a central dashboard where you can see the logs for all your clients\u2019 WordPress sites.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you and your clients can also view and search the audit trail from inside each WordPress site.<\/p>\n<p>The image on this screen shows what you\u2019ll see inside WordPress after installing the Logtivity plugin.<\/p>\n<p>All of the activity log data is visible and searchable in the WordPress admin area.

With plugin, even a simple history of user activities can stress your site&#8217;s database.<\/p>\n<p>Logtivity is able to handle exports for even the biggest WordPress sites! If your clients\u2019 site uses Logtivity, you can export millions and millions of logs.<\/p>\n<p>In the image next to this text, you can see over a dozen CSV files. Each of these files is a Logtivity export that contains 100,000 logs. This export has 13 files, so it\u2019s over 1,300,000 million logs in total.<\/p>\n<p>Logtivity is the activity log solution for large WordPress sites!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/features\/large-exports\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about log exports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Logtivity has a White Label Mode for Agencies<\/h3>\n<p>The most frequent users of Logtivity are WordPress agencies and maintenance services who want to keep an eye on lots of websites. Logtivity is the audit tool that agencies need.<\/p>\n<p>Agencies and maintenance services often white label the services they use, and so we\u2019ve made this possible for Logtivity also.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a \u201cWhite Label Mode\u201d in Logtivity, so you can provide the smoothest experience possible for clients. You can remove all the references to Logtivity from the WordPress admin area.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/features\/white-label\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about the White Label mode<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Join Logtivity and Start Your Monitoring<\/h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Logtivity is a SaaS service<\/strong><br \/>\n  You will need to create a Logtivity account to store your activity logs and create alerts. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.logtivity.io\/register\" title=\"Logtivity\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Click here to get started with Logtivity!<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>How does Logtivity compare to other activity log plugins?<\/h3>\n<p>There are some good WordPress activity log plugins including WP Activity Log, WP User Activity, User Activity Log, Activity Log, WP Cerber, Jetpack activity log, User Activity Tracking and Log, WP Stream, Simple History, Aryo Activity Log and more.<\/p>\n<p>Logtivity is different from those plugins in several important ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is a hosted error log service, so you don&#8217;t have to store all the data in your site&#8217;s database. This can really slow down your site! Logtivity allows you to store much more data, and export it more easily.<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s an error log service to you can see what activity connects to which errors.<\/li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a deeper integration with key plugins such as Easy Digital Downloads and MemberPress.<\/li>\n<li>You can visualize your data with Logtivity&#8217;s charts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

If the plugin uses post types, we record when most post types are updated, created or deleted.<\/p>\n<p>We currently have integrations with Easy Digital Downloads, Memberpress and Download Monitor. These integrations allow you to track things like Memberpress subscription creations, changes, or cancellations and also track when files are downloaded through Download Monitor.<\/p>\n<p>We are working on more detailed event monitor support for some key plugins, including eCommerce plugins such as WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.<\/p>\n<p>Please contact us for specific details on any plugin that you are using.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20log%20custom%20events%3F'>\nCan I log custom events?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, our user activity tracking plugin provides a flexible API to log and store custom events with Logtivity. An example of logging a custom event is below. This example is recording information from Stripe.com for a customer:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Logtivity::log()\n    -&gt;setAction('My Custom Action')\n    -&gt;addMeta('Meta Label', $meta)\n    -&gt;addMeta('Another Meta label', $someOtherMeta)\n    -&gt;addUserMeta('Stripe Customer ID', $stripeCustomerId)\n    -&gt;send();\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/docs\/custom-events\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about custom activity logs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20user%20activities%20does%20logtivity%20record%3F'>\nWhat user activities does Logtivity record?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Logtivity records all core WordPress actions.

You need user tracking because you need to know many people are visiting, making purchases, and logging in to your site. Yes, you can track visitors with Google Analytics, and you can track purchases with your payment gateway, but it\u2019s harder to track WordPress-specific information such as log ins. Using Logtivity, you can get an overview of who is logging in to your site, and how many people are logging in every day.<\/p>\n<p>If Logtivity is active on your site, you can go to the \u201cLogs\u201d screen and search for all the \u201cUser Logged in\u201d events. You can use the search boxes to drill down for more specific user tracking information. For example, you can use the \u201cContext\u201d box to search for a particular user role. You can use this to search for all &#8220;Administrator&#8221; logins or all &#8220;Editor&#8221; logins.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the search option as a security log and look for nefarious patterns in the audit logs. For example, you can search by IP address to see if one person is using multiple logins. Or you can search by username to see if one account is being shared by different people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/track-user-logins-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about activity logs for user logins<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20logtivity%20a%20gdpr-compliant%20activity%20log%3F'>\nIs Logtivity a GDPR-compliant activity log?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Logtivity gives you complete control over the user tracking information recorded in the audit logs. You can choose your GDPR settings. You can decide to only log a profile link, user ID, username, IP address, or nothing at all.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inside your WordPress site, go to \u201cTools\u201d and then \u201cLogtivity\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>You can uncheck the boxes on this screen to stop Logtivity from recording personal user trackking data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of the key GDPR-compliant settings:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store User ID: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users User ID in the logged action.<\/li>\n<li>Store Users Profile Link: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users profile link in the logged action.<\/li>\n<li>Store Users Username: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users username in the logged action.<\/li>\n<li>Store Users IP Address: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users IP address in the logged action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/docs\/personal-data\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here for more about the GDPR and activity logs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20all%20activity%20logs%20and%20only%20store%20custom%20logs%3F'>\nCan I disable all activity logs and only store custom logs?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

For example, you can add this code to your site\u2019s functions.php file. This code will result in an event \u201cFile Downloaded\u201d being logged as \u201cResource Downloaded\u201d.<\/p>\n<pre><code>add_action('wp_logtivity_instance', function($Logtivity_Logger) {\n    if (strpos($Logtivity_Logger-&gt;action, 'File Downloaded') !== false) {\n        $Logtivity_Logger-&gt;setAction('Resource Downloaded');\n    }\n});\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/logtivity.io\/docs\/rename-events\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here for more about renaming activity logs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20the%20activity%20logs%3F'>\nCan I export the activity logs?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Logtivity makes it easy to export your user activity data into a CSV file.
