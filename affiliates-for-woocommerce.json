        "description": "<p>Affiliates for WooCommerce is a plugin that allows site owners to create an affiliate marketing program for their online store. The plugin allows affiliates to promote the store and earn a commission on sales made through their unique affiliate links.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing where businesses pay affiliates for each customer they bring to their website. The affiliate promotes the business&#8217;s products or services through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, or their website, and earns a commission for each sale made through their unique affiliate link.<\/p>\n<p>With Affiliates for WooCommerce, site owners can easily set up an affiliate program and recruit affiliates to promote their products. The plugin provides a dashboard where affiliates can view their earnings, track clicks and sales, and access marketing materials such as banners and text links. Affiliates can also generate their unique affiliate links, which they can share with their audience to earn commissions on any sales made through those links.<\/p>\n<p>Site owners have complete control over their affiliate program, including setting commission rates, defining cookie expiration periods, and setting minimum payout thresholds. They can also view reports on affiliate activity, including the number of clicks, impressions, and conversions.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/demo.devdiggers.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce-affiliates-free\/\" title=\"Live Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Live Demo<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/affiliates-for-woocommerce\/\" title=\"Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Documentation<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/product\/woocommerce-affiliates\/\" title=\"Premium Version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Premium Version<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/woocommerce-extensions\/\" title=\"WooCommerce Extensions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Extensions<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>\u26a1\ufe0f FEATURES OF THE AFFILIATES FOR WOOCOMMERCE FREE VERSION<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Module can be enabled or disabled by the admin.<\/li>\n<li>Allow other user roles to be able to converted into affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Default registration form can be used for the affiliate registration and for existing users to become an affiliate.<\/li>\n<li>Enable\/disable the affiliate registration fields on the WooCommerce registration form shown in the My Accounts Page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the affiliate registration form shortcode to create a custom page for your affiliates registration.<\/li>\n<li>Set the affiliate dashboard page which contains the shortcode.<\/li>\n<li>Styling color can be set for the affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Sidebar widgets can be enabled or disabled for the affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Choose to show Affiliate dashboard menu on the my accounts page.<\/li>\n<li>Enable\/disable the sidebar widgets on the Affiliate dashboard menu on the My Accounts page.<\/li>\n<li>Query variable name can be dynamically configured.<\/li>\n<li>Referral cookie name can be dynamically configured.<\/li>\n<li>Set the number of days for the referral cookie expiration.<\/li>\n<li>Enable or disable the visits registration for the referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Social share options are available for sharing referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Set the title for twitter and pinterest social share for referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Set the text for social share of referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Pinterest image url can be set for the social share.<\/li>\n<li>Set a global or default commission rate for all affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Taxes and discounts can be included or excluded for commission calculations.<\/li>\n<li>Configure withdrawal or payout methods for the earnings.<\/li>\n<li>Set the shortcode dynamically for the affiliate registration form and affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the content of the affiliate registration form with login form or without.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of the affiliates and can manage their active status.<\/li>\n<li>Various information of the affiliate can be seen and managed by the admin.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of earned commissions and manage their status.<\/li>\n<li>Pay the commission manually to affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of payouts and change their status.<\/li>\n<li>All payouts are handled externally the system and manage manually by admin.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of top products that generated earnings.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of visits registered by the affiliate referred URL.<\/li>\n<li>Various filters are given in affiliates, commissions, payouts, top products and visits list.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent affiliates from getting commissions by their own purchases.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can view the list of their commissions, payouts, visits and top products.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can generate links with their referral tokens and can share them on various social platforms in order to earn money.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can save their withdrawal info.<\/li>\n<li>Default withdrawal method can be chosen by affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can earn commissions for both registered and non-registered customers&#8217;

    "description": "<p>Affiliates for WooCommerce is a plugin that allows site owners to create an affiliate marketing program for their online store. The plugin allows affiliates to promote the store and earn a commission on sales made through their unique affiliate links.<\/p>\n<p>Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing where businesses pay affiliates for each customer they bring to their website. The affiliate promotes the business&#8217;s products or services through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, or their website, and earns a commission for each sale made through their unique affiliate link.<\/p>\n<p>With Affiliates for WooCommerce, site owners can easily set up an affiliate program and recruit affiliates to promote their products. The plugin provides a dashboard where affiliates can view their earnings, track clicks and sales, and access marketing materials such as banners and text links. Affiliates can also generate their unique affiliate links, which they can share with their audience to earn commissions on any sales made through those links.<\/p>\n<p>Site owners have complete control over their affiliate program, including setting commission rates, defining cookie expiration periods, and setting minimum payout thresholds. They can also view reports on affiliate activity, including the number of clicks, impressions, and conversions.<\/p>\n<p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/demo.devdiggers.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce-affiliates-free\/\" title=\"Live Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Live Demo<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/affiliates-for-woocommerce\/\" title=\"Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Documentation<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/product\/woocommerce-affiliates\/\" title=\"Premium Version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Affiliates for WooCommerce Premium Version<\/a><br \/>\n\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https:\/\/devdiggers.com\/woocommerce-extensions\/\" title=\"WooCommerce Extensions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Extensions<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>\u26a1\ufe0f FEATURES OF THE AFFILIATES FOR WOOCOMMERCE FREE VERSION<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Module can be enabled or disabled by the admin.<\/li>\n<li>Allow other user roles to be able to converted into affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Default registration form can be used for the affiliate registration and for existing users to become an affiliate.<\/li>\n<li>Enable\/disable the affiliate registration fields on the WooCommerce registration form shown in the My Accounts Page.<\/li>\n<li>Use the affiliate registration form shortcode to create a custom page for your affiliates registration.<\/li>\n<li>Set the affiliate dashboard page which contains the shortcode.<\/li>\n<li>Styling color can be set for the affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Sidebar widgets can be enabled or disabled for the affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Choose to show Affiliate dashboard menu on the my accounts page.<\/li>\n<li>Enable\/disable the sidebar widgets on the Affiliate dashboard menu on the My Accounts page.<\/li>\n<li>Query variable name can be dynamically configured.<\/li>\n<li>Referral cookie name can be dynamically configured.<\/li>\n<li>Set the number of days for the referral cookie expiration.<\/li>\n<li>Enable or disable the visits registration for the referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Social share options are available for sharing referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Set the title for twitter and pinterest social share for referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Set the text for social share of referral links.<\/li>\n<li>Pinterest image url can be set for the social share.<\/li>\n<li>Set a global or default commission rate for all affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Taxes and discounts can be included or excluded for commission calculations.<\/li>\n<li>Configure withdrawal or payout methods for the earnings.<\/li>\n<li>Set the shortcode dynamically for the affiliate registration form and affiliate dashboard.<\/li>\n<li>Choose the content of the affiliate registration form with login form or without.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of the affiliates and can manage their active status.<\/li>\n<li>Various information of the affiliate can be seen and managed by the admin.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of earned commissions and manage their status.<\/li>\n<li>Pay the commission manually to affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of payouts and change their status.<\/li>\n<li>All payouts are handled externally the system and manage manually by admin.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of top products that generated earnings.<\/li>\n<li>View the list of visits registered by the affiliate referred URL.<\/li>\n<li>Various filters are given in affiliates, commissions, payouts, top products and visits list.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent affiliates from getting commissions by their own purchases.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can view the list of their commissions, payouts, visits and top products.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can generate links with their referral tokens and can share them on various social platforms in order to earn money.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can save their withdrawal info.<\/li>\n<li>Default withdrawal method can be chosen by affiliates.<\/li>\n<li>Affiliates can earn commissions for both registered and non-registered customers&#8217;
