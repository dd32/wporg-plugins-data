Many people talked about receiving great support, perhaps unusually great support. I chatted with support for pre-sale questions in the middle of the night and they were very helpful then since purchasing plugins from them they are equally helpful. When you need support, one specialist will deal with it and sought it out. It's not like you are being passed around many different departments and getting frustrated like with some places.
