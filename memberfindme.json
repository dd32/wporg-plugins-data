        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20this%20a%20paid%20plugin%3F'>\nIs this a paid plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is an interface to your MembershipWorks account, much like how MailChimp or Google Maps plugins are an interface to those systems. When you embed a Google Map on your web page, the map is not generated from your WordPress server. Similarly the heavy lifting and processing for our system happens on our side, including all data storage (triple redundant with daily backups), email delivery, security, updates and compliance. The plugin provides the convenience of integrating features on the website with shortcodes, provides an admin panel on the WordPress dashboard, and checks access on member only pages\/posts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20setup%20the%20pages%20for%20membership%20sign-up%2C%20directory%2C%20deals%2C%20event%20calendar%2C%20etc%3F'>\nHow do I setup the pages for membership sign-up, directory, deals, event calendar, etc?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create pages and put the corresponding shortcode on the page. The shortcode generator can be found in the Help section under MembershipWorks &gt; Help &gt; Basics &amp; Setup &gt; WordPress &gt; WordPress Shortcodes.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20the%20documentation%3F'>\nWhere can I find the documentation?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Help section provides all the documentation.

This allows for one page checkout, and for us to track fees and payments, issue refunds, and more.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not have Paypal Pro and do not want to deal with the fees, we recommend using Stripe.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20colors%20in%20the%20membership%20forms%2C%20events%2C%20etc%3F'>\nCan I customize the colors in the membership forms, events, etc?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Information about customizing CSS can be found in the plugin under MembershipWorks &gt; Help &gt; Customization &gt; CSS &amp; colors<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20restrict%20access%20to%20a%20page%20or%20post%20to%20members%20only%3F'>\nHow do I restrict access to a page or post to members only?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>To restrict the content of the entire post\/page to members, place the &#091;memberonly&#093; shortcode at the beginning of the post\/page.

Since we helped the organization move from paper to this electronic platform, membership has more than doubled.  Payments and cash flow are nearly 100% automated and members manage their own profiles.\n\nI like the ability to login and manage membership outside of Wordpress - the software makes it very easy to do this.  Member management generally requires more time than website management.    \n\nDocumentation available (you could always create a free account to check it out) and whenever I run into a question, the email support team has been quick and thorough.  I've even used phone support a few times - but find that email and documentation works most of the time.  The UI is clean and well thought out.\n\nNo software has every feature you want or need, but in practically every case, MembershipWorks has helped me come up with a solution. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">great membership plugin for a professional association<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wcamembers\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/59fda200d47e27588a2aa61a78f56317?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/59fda200d47e27588a2aa61a78f56317?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/wcamembers\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">wcamembers<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 13, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Our organization of professional communicators is helped immensely by this membership plugin! We have had membership software in the past that was much more expensive and didn't integrate with WordPress. We use just about every part of the plugin including the event calendar feature, membership database, directory, forms and shopping cart. The MailChimp integration allows us to use our favorite email marketing platform (that many of our volunteers are familiar with already) for our communications with members and prospects. Given our annual turnover of the board that runs our association, the training and support MembershipWorks provides is so helpful in transitioning from one board term to the next. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Inflexible system with lots of limitations<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cherylweb27\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6bf134c3c9aa7ededcdf643f04ccba8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c6bf134c3c9aa7ededcdf643f04ccba8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/cherylweb27\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">cherylweb27<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 10, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">In reviewing the plugin's website and description, this seems like a feature-rich system. NOPE. It has so many limitations you won't believe it. Documentation isn't available until AFTER you install the plugin, so there's no way to know if it's going to work for your needs until AFTER you're working with it. And YES, there is an API... but it doesn't help with some of the simplest isseus.\n\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of what this plugin can NOT do:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Sort events by multiple filters: Currently the ONLY way to sort events is category. But a second searchable\/filterable\/sortable option seems only logical. Why can't I sort events by category AND location???? (They suggest having TONS of categories just to accommodate every location. NOT an acceptable work-around.)<\/li>\n\n\t<li>Load more than one shortcode per page. <\/li>\n\n\t<li>Paginate the directory listing page.<\/li>\n\n\t<li>Sort members by anything other than one category. <\/li>\n\n\t<li>Control what loads on the membership \"cards.\" Right now all it shows is a big rectangle with a name. VERY BORING AND UNATTRACTIVE.<\/li>\n\n\t<li>Display members in a list, rather than those big awkward \"cards.\"<\/li>\n\n\t<li>Alphabetize category lists. They'll display in whatever order you create them. Period.<\/li>\n <\/ol>\n\nThe ONLY bright spot is the support. Email support answered typically in 24-48 hours.\n\nI am SO DONE with this system. I'll be looking elsewhere from now on.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Amazing support -<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ahufford\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3a120c232a906c10f2dd1d84db929d35?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3a120c232a906c10f2dd1d84db929d35?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/ahufford\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">ahufford<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 20, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I could not be a bigger fan of this plugin and the great support they provide.

On the other hand, it was simple to integrate and manages several types of systems well: membership registration, renewals, payments, event promotion, event ticketing (with member-specific pricing), an event calendar, and email system to members and event registrants all in one. Rather than having these all be independent systems, it's all integrated. That means, though, that those systems may not be as fully developed as stand-alone systems, but the ability to have them all interoperate is a real boost. \n\nI hope they'll work on expanding features (beefing up the email system to include templated emails to members, other than the automated emails which are templated, for example). And it's also a bit odd that they use G+ for support, which means asking questions and reporting issues is public rather than private. But they do respond quickly and will take issues private if needed.\n\nAnd yes, it is a plugin that requires payment for groups of more than 50 members, or if you want to connect it to a payment processor. But it's an affordable option for many clubs\/organizations, and can help even novice WP builders get something workable and polished up at a negligible cost.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Yay for multiple renewal notices!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mbtorg\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b33a7d796fec985cf6d7fa75d157a80d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/b33a7d796fec985cf6d7fa75d157a80d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mbtorg\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mbtorg<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 3, 2016<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><p>We love MemberFindMe!
