You\u2019ll have to manually edit your old posts if you have always inserted images with Page URL before, Flip Box or any other plugin like that cannot import images from the outer link for you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to make sure that you have all the needed media and their Auto-detect options activated on your Settings &gt; Media library page. If you are using images in other formats like JPG, GIF or PNG, you need to add the extensions with the image link to the Auto-detect the field for Images.
