Gamification has changed our return on ad spend like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. THANK YOU Promolayer team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FastFeet on Wix<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Great app, easy to setup, works like a charm. Support team are there to help if needed, but on my side, it was not an issue. I really recommend Promolayer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Techtoids on Shopify<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Integrations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Promolayer integrates natively with Mailchimp and Klaviyo. A webhook is available to send data through Zapier to thousands of other services such as Active Campaign, Aweber, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, Drip, Gmail, Hustle, Mailchimp, Ontraport, Outlook, Salesforce, Sendinblue, WP Fusion, Zoho, Hubspot etc.<\/p>\n<p>Our custom HTML component allows you to add quizzes, social share buttons (such as Messenger and Line buttons) Opinion Stage polls, Apester, Google surveys, Google maps, Typeform, Jotform, Wufoo and many more.<\/p>\n<p>Promolayer is designed from the ground up for conversion rate optimization. However, it&#8217;s compatible with other testing and analytics tools such as Hotjar, Lucky Orange, ClickTale, FullStory Smartlook, Crazyegg, MouseFlow or any other heatmap and session recording tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pricing<\/strong><br \/>\nPromolayers free plan is available for the first 1,000 popup views \/ month and doesn&#8217;t require a credit card to start.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time with overpriced platforms like KARTE (\u30ab\u30eb\u30c6), Combeez, Robee, Popee, Sprocket or Channel that cost up to 20x what Promolayer does, often with less functionality. Skyrocket your conversions without breaking the bank.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Promolayer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Promolayer was created in Japan. Firstly out of frustration with other global platforms like Poptin, Optinmonster, Hubspot, Privy etc that both don&#8217;t fully support Japanese or have Japanese templates and overcharge for the service. Since then Promolayer has grown and grown and now fully supports English and is bringing world-class Japanese design sense and customer service to the global market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking for more information about our features?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For our English-speaking customers, please visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Promolayers popup builder\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Popup builder<\/a>s homepage.<\/p>\n<p>For our Japanese speaker customers you can find information on specifics such as <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Abadonment prevention popups\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">abandonment prevention popups<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B4%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1%E5%AF%BE%E7%AD%96\/\" title=\"cart abandonment reduction\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cart abandonment reduction<\/a> and our <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Popup tool\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">popup tool<\/a> at the Promolayer homepage.<\/p>\n",

Isn&#8217;t this just a gateway to a SaaS?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin lets us tighten our integrations with WordPress. Aside from one-click installation and auto domain re-configuring when you migrate between environments our plugin also allows for automatic coupon generation and cart integrations with WooCommerce which wouldn&#8217;t be possible without a plugin.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use the plugin you can sign up for a generic account at promolayer.io and just copy paste a single line of code in. Please be aware in doing so you will not have access to all auto configurations and coupon \/ cart integrations.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20popup%20views%20counted%3F'>\nHow are popup views counted?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every time the Promolayer plugin generates content on a page a single view is counted. We feel this is a very fair way of counting as if you have a welcome popup set to only show once you will only be charged for a single view per user no matter how many more pages the user sees. If you are a heavy user with popups on every page then each page will be counted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20well%20does%20promolayer%20convert%3F'>\nHow well does Promolayer convert?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Expect conversion rates to be fantastic. Our platform has proven to convert at consistently higher rates than our competitors due to our highly-usable forms and CVR focused features such as real time email domain correction.<\/p>\n<p>The final conversion rate will depend on your usage of the platform, the deals you offer your customers and the design and triggering you choose. For our paying customers we&#8217;ve got a team of CRO experts on hand to help you maximize your conversion rate.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20developer%20to%20get%20started%3F'>\nDo I need a developer to get started?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Promolayer plugin auto-integrates everything.

Gamification has changed our return on ad spend like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. THANK YOU Promolayer team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FastFeet on Wix<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Great app, easy to setup, works like a charm. Support team are there to help if needed, but on my side, it was not an issue. I really recommend Promolayer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Techtoids on Shopify<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Integrations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Promolayer integrates natively with Mailchimp and Klaviyo. A webhook is available to send data through Zapier to thousands of other services such as Active Campaign, Aweber, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, Drip, Gmail, Hustle, Mailchimp, Ontraport, Outlook, Salesforce, Sendinblue, WP Fusion, Zoho, Hubspot etc.<\/p>\n<p>Our custom HTML component allows you to add quizzes, social share buttons (such as Messenger and Line buttons) Opinion Stage polls, Apester, Google surveys, Google maps, Typeform, Jotform, Wufoo and many more.<\/p>\n<p>Promolayer is designed from the ground up for conversion rate optimization. However, it&#8217;s compatible with other testing and analytics tools such as Hotjar, Lucky Orange, ClickTale, FullStory Smartlook, Crazyegg, MouseFlow or any other heatmap and session recording tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pricing<\/strong><br \/>\nPromolayers free plan is available for the first 1,000 popup views \/ month and doesn&#8217;t require a credit card to start.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time with overpriced platforms like KARTE (\u30ab\u30eb\u30c6), Combeez, Robee, Popee, Sprocket or Channel that cost up to 20x what Promolayer does, often with less functionality. Skyrocket your conversions without breaking the bank.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Promolayer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Promolayer was created in Japan. Firstly out of frustration with other global platforms like Poptin, Optinmonster, Hubspot, Privy etc that both don&#8217;t fully support Japanese or have Japanese templates and overcharge for the service. Since then Promolayer has grown and grown and now fully supports English and is bringing world-class Japanese design sense and customer service to the global market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking for more information about our features?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For our English-speaking customers, please visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Promolayers popup builder\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Popup builder<\/a>s homepage.<\/p>\n<p>For our Japanese speaker customers you can find information on specifics such as <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Abadonment prevention popups\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">abandonment prevention popups<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B4%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1%E5%AF%BE%E7%AD%96\/\" title=\"cart abandonment reduction\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cart abandonment reduction<\/a> and our <a href=\"https:\/\/promolayer.io\/\" title=\"Popup tool\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">popup tool<\/a> at the Promolayer homepage.<\/p>\n",
