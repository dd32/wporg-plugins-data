        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don\u2019t need to leave your web browser. To<br \/>\nautomatically install WooCommerce Gateway Affirm, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click <strong>Add New<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;WooCommerce Gateway Affirm&#8221; and click <strong>Search Plugins<\/strong>. Once you&#8217;ve found our plugin you can install it by clicking <strong>Install Now<\/strong>, as well as view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Updating<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.<\/p>\n",

Common issues include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript errors on checkout page \u2013 To view the error, open your browser error console (in Chrome: View &gt; developer &gt; JavaScript console) and look for red errors. This should indicate where the error is located and lead you to the problem, e.g., Loading jQuery incorrectly<\/li>\n<li>Failing to load scripts \u2013 Affirm loads JavaScript which it needs to function. If these are not loaded, you will see errors. Most common reasons are:\n<ul>\n<li>Theme is missing wp_head() or wp_footer() calls.<\/li>\n<li>Old overridden template files from WooCommerce inside your theme.<\/li>\n<li>Loading headers\/footers in a non-standard way. WooCommerce uses get_header()\u2019s get_header action to init the checkout and load scripts. If you are not using get_header() you either need to do so, or you need to trigger the get_header action manually using: do_action( \u2018get_header ); in your custom header loader.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20override%20templates%20on%20the%20affirm%20pages%3F'>\nIs it possible to override templates on the Affirm pages?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. These are fixed\/static pages from Affirm.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20the%20enhanced%20analytics%20box%20be%20unticked%3F'>\nWhy should the Enhanced Analytics box be unticked?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time the feature is inactive on stores.
