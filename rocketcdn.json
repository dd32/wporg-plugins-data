        "description": "<p>RocketCDN is a premium optimized Content Delivery Network that helps you deliver your content at the speed of light.<\/p>\n<p>If your website aims to reach an international audience, the distance from your visitors\u2019 origin server has a significant impact on performance. With RocketCDN, anyone can access your content quickly, no matter where they are in the world! Forget configuration headaches too, we automatically apply the best CDN configuration to boost your speed and performance grades.<\/p>\n<p>Reduce latency, round trip time (RTT) and save bandwidth costs with our customized Content Delivery Network: RocketCDN is here to make your website faster and your visitors happy.<\/p>\n<p>RocketCDN is the best CDN plugin for WordPress &#8212; the integration to your site is easy and straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve installed and activated RocketCDN to your WordPress site, the plugin will automatically rewrite all URLs, such as those for CSS, JavaScript, and images, to be served by a content delivery network. You will be able to link up your assets to your RocketCDN custom CName. Moreover, the CDN cache can be cleared from WordPress, making your content always up to date, super easily.<\/p>\n<h4>WHAT IS A CDN AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?<\/h4>\n<p>The acronym CDN stands for Content Delivery Network: a CDN establishes a globally distributed network of edge servers between your website\u2019s origin server and your visitors\u2019 location.<\/p>\n<p>Once the content of your site passes through them for the first time, the edge servers keep a copy of the static content (images, CSS, and JavaScript files) and then deliver it to the end-users, allowing them to access the content a lot faster. Here\u2019s an in-depth guide to learning more about <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/what-is-a-cdn\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">what\u2019s a CDN and how it works<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With a CDN, every HTTP request made by your users will be served from the nearest location possible, no matter where they\u2019re geographically located.<\/p>\n<p>If your website is serving a broad international audience, reaching people all over the world, the distance between your website\u2019s server and your users is one of the crucial factors of web performance.<\/p>\n<p>Think of a Content Delivery Network as a bridge that makes users closer to the websites they\u2019re visiting, no matter where they are around the globe!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/benefits-cdn\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Using a CDN has many benefits<\/a>, one of them is to help your site improve both PageSpeed Insights score and Core Web Vitals grades.<\/p>\n<h4>WHAT ABOUT PAGESPEED INSIGHTS AND THE CORE WEB VITALS?<\/h4>\n<p>If you think that Google loves fast and secure websites, we can indeed confirm that enabling a CDN on your site is also beneficial for SEO and the PageSpeed Insights performance score. In fact, using a Content Delivery Network can boost the <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/improve-largest-contentful-paint\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Largest Contentful Paint score<\/a> \u2013 one of the Core Web Vitals metrics.<\/p>\n<p>A CDN also helps address two PageSpeed Insights recommendations, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/serve-static-assets-with-an-efficient-cache-policy\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy<\/a> and Enable text compression.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, a CDN can also have a positive impact on your server response time. Server response time is the amount of time required between the moment a visitor makes a request (clicks on a link for example) to the moment the server responds to that request. According to Google PageSpeed Insights, you should aim for a server response time of less than 200 ms. The response time of a server is typically measured with what is known as time to first byte (TTFB).<\/p>\n<p>Your website\u2019s loading time significantly affects user experience which is why <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/reduce-ttfb-server-response-times\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reducing server response time<\/a> should be a primary goal of website owners and SEO experts.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, a CDN will deliver HTTP requests faster \u2013 another way to <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/lighthouse-performance-score-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">improve the Lighthouse performance score<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin allows you to easily enable RocketCDN on your WordPress website. You can simply install the plugin, activate it, and add the RocketCDN API key provided in your account.<\/p>\n<p>Then all of your static assets on your website will be served through our content delivery network. Wherever your audience is, our +120 edge locations powered by Bunny CDN can easily handle large volume traffic and unexpected peaks to deliver your content at the speed of light. Bunny CDN edge locations are strategically deployed in 6 continents and 77 countries to ensure a carefully optimized global network.<\/p>\n<p>Created by the WP Rocket team, RocketCDN also automatically applies the best CDN settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cache expiration policy, GZIP compression, HTTP2\u2026 we set everything up to boost your speed and performance scores. Remember: a faster loading website will help you meet Core Web Vitals requirements. Don\u2019t stress over the amount of bandwidth and number of requests either. With RocketCDN, experience high performance with unlimited bandwidth.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, using RocketCDN requires absolutely no technical knowledge. You won\u2019t waste your time going through numerous tabs and complicated customization options. With our easy-to-navigate interface, we make CDN technology available to all. Let us do the heavy lifting, enjoy our custom automated Content Delivery Network settings.<\/p>\n<h4>WHO ARE WE?<\/h4>\n<p>We are WP Media, the startup behind WP Rocket, the best caching plugin for WordPress, and Imagify, the most advanced tool to optimize images.<\/p>\n<h4>GET IN TOUCH!<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Website: <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RocketCDN<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Contact Us: <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/contact<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RocketCDN\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/RocketCDN<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Facebook: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rocketcdn.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rocketcdn.me<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Related Plugins<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Rocket<\/a>: Best caching plugin to speed up your WordPress website.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/imagify.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Imagify<\/a>: The most advanced tool to optimize images.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/rocket-lazy-load\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Lazy Load<\/a>: Best Lazy Load script to reduce the number of HTTP requests and improve the website&#8217;s loading time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

Our team is always ready to assist if you have any questions or issues with our CDN. You can contact them through <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/contact\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20cname%20customization%2C%20aka%20a%20%E2%80%9Cvanity%20url%E2%80%9D%3F'>\nDo you offer CNAME customization, aka a \u201cvanity URL\u201d?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We decided to not offer the CNAME customization because:<br \/>\n&#8211; It would require a valid SSL certificate that supports subdomains on your side, the lack of which can affect the CDN\u2019s functionality.<br \/>\n&#8211; There isn\u2019t any real benefit from having one except for avoiding SEO penalties for duplicate content. To avoid this we automatically set canonical headers.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20rocketcdn%20on%20unlimited%20sites%3F'>\nCan I use RocketCDN on unlimited sites?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Each site requires its own RocketCDN subscription. Therefore, if you have a staging site and a production site, you won&#8217;t be able to transfer RocketCDN between them, you should subscribe using your production site.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20rocketcdn%20in%20addition%20to%20cloudflare%3F'>\nCan I use RocketCDN in addition to Cloudflare?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use RocketCDN and Cloudflare together. Cloudflare is not a traditional CDN (technically speaking, it\u2019s a proxy) therefore it\u2019s possible to use it at the same time as RocketCDN.<\/p>\n<p>Cloudflare provides other useful features related to security, for example. RocketCDN will take care of delivering static files &#8211; JS, CSS, images &#8211; to your visitors from servers close to them.<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of RocketCDN is that we\u2019ve created the service to configure everything optimally for you. We do the following automatically:<br \/>\n&#8211; Create your unique rocketcdn.me CNAME &#8211; (this cannot be changed or customized.)<br \/>\n&#8211; Apply GZIP compression<br \/>\n&#8211; Apply CORS headers for webfont compatibility<br \/>\n&#8211; Set a cache-control browser cache header<br \/>\n&#8211; Serve assets over HTTP\/2<\/p>\n<p>RocketCDN also provides these benefits:<br \/>\n&#8211; Unlimited bandwidth<br \/>\n&#8211; We reserve the right to disable your RocketCDN Url if we detect bandwidth overuse<br \/>\n&#8211; All CDN files automatically served over HTTPS<br \/>\n&#8211; SSL Traffic included<br \/>\n&#8211; All Global PoPs (Points of Presence) included<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to choose only one service to use, we cannot say which is better, they are simply different, so you would have to perform tests to check the results for your specific site.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%E2%80%99s%20the%20difference%20between%20rocketcdn%20and%20bunny%20cdn%3F'>\nWhat\u2019s the difference between RocketCDN and Bunny CDN?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>RocketCDN provides a convenient and fast, one-click setup. We take care of the ideal setup automatically so you don\u2019t have to spend any time on it. If you go through Bunny CDN directly, it requires manual configuration. If you have only one site it will be cheaper to use RocketCDN. For multiple sites, Bunny CDN is cheaper, although you\u2019ll invest more time in setup.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20rocketcdn%20and%20jetpack%20site%20accelerator%3F'>\nCan I use RocketCDN and Jetpack Site Accelerator?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You should disable Jetpack site accelerator when using RocketCDN.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20amazon%20s3%20with%20rocketcdn%3F'>\nCan I use Amazon S3 with RocketCDN?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Amazon S3 can&#8217;t be used with another CDN provider like RocketCDN.

It's also among the average performing CDNs according to data gathered by CDNPerf. \n\nConsider doing it like 5CentsCDN that has teamed up with G-Core Labs for offering standard tier plans and Akamai for Business and Enterprise plans without breaking the bank. Their only problem is the complex set-up process, which RocketCDN shines (Almost feels like plug-and-play). \n\nLooking for more into the future. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"

    "description": "<p>RocketCDN is a premium optimized Content Delivery Network that helps you deliver your content at the speed of light.<\/p>\n<p>If your website aims to reach an international audience, the distance from your visitors\u2019 origin server has a significant impact on performance. With RocketCDN, anyone can access your content quickly, no matter where they are in the world! Forget configuration headaches too, we automatically apply the best CDN configuration to boost your speed and performance grades.<\/p>\n<p>Reduce latency, round trip time (RTT) and save bandwidth costs with our customized Content Delivery Network: RocketCDN is here to make your website faster and your visitors happy.<\/p>\n<p>RocketCDN is the best CDN plugin for WordPress &#8212; the integration to your site is easy and straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve installed and activated RocketCDN to your WordPress site, the plugin will automatically rewrite all URLs, such as those for CSS, JavaScript, and images, to be served by a content delivery network. You will be able to link up your assets to your RocketCDN custom CName. Moreover, the CDN cache can be cleared from WordPress, making your content always up to date, super easily.<\/p>\n<h4>WHAT IS A CDN AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?<\/h4>\n<p>The acronym CDN stands for Content Delivery Network: a CDN establishes a globally distributed network of edge servers between your website\u2019s origin server and your visitors\u2019 location.<\/p>\n<p>Once the content of your site passes through them for the first time, the edge servers keep a copy of the static content (images, CSS, and JavaScript files) and then deliver it to the end-users, allowing them to access the content a lot faster. Here\u2019s an in-depth guide to learning more about <a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/what-is-a-cdn\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">what\u2019s a CDN and how it works<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With a CDN, every HTTP request made by your users will be served from the nearest location possible, no matter where they\u2019re geographically located.<\/p>\n<p>If your website is serving a broad international audience, reaching people all over the world, the distance between your website\u2019s server and your users is one of the crucial factors of web performance.<\/p>\n<p>Think of a Content Delivery Network as a bridge that makes users closer to the websites they\u2019re visiting, no matter where they are around the globe!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/rocketcdn.me\/benefits-cdn\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Using a CDN has many benefits<\/a>, one of them is to help your site improve both PageSpeed Insights score and Core Web Vitals grades.<\/p>\n<h4>WHAT ABOUT PAGESPEED INSIGHTS AND THE CORE WEB VITALS?<\/h4>\n<p>If you think that Google loves fast and secure websites, we can indeed confirm that enabling a CDN on your site is also beneficial for SEO and the PageSpeed Insights performance score. In fact, using a Content Delivery Network can boost the <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/improve-largest-contentful-paint\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Largest Contentful Paint score<\/a> \u2013 one of the Core Web Vitals metrics.<\/p>\n<p>A CDN also helps address two PageSpeed Insights recommendations, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/serve-static-assets-with-an-efficient-cache-policy\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy<\/a> and Enable text compression.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, a CDN can also have a positive impact on your server response time. Server response time is the amount of time required between the moment a visitor makes a request (clicks on a link for example) to the moment the server responds to that request. According to Google PageSpeed Insights, you should aim for a server response time of less than 200 ms. The response time of a server is typically measured with what is known as time to first byte (TTFB).<\/p>\n<p>Your website\u2019s loading time significantly affects user experience which is why <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/google-core-web-vitals-wordpress\/reduce-ttfb-server-response-times\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reducing server response time<\/a> should be a primary goal of website owners and SEO experts.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, a CDN will deliver HTTP requests faster \u2013 another way to <a href=\"https:\/\/wp-rocket.me\/lighthouse-performance-score-wordpress\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">improve the Lighthouse performance score<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?<\/h4>\n<p>Our plugin allows you to easily enable RocketCDN on your WordPress website.
