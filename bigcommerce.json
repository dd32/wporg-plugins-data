        "description": "<p>BigCommerce for WordPress is a plugin that allows you to scale ecommerce further than ever before on WordPress. Scale your business with WordPress on the front-end and free up server resources from things like catalog management, processing payments, managing fulfillment logistics and more with BigCommerce on the back end.<\/p>\n<p>Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, you get access to our native ecommerce features from a single plugin, the ability to sell across multiple channels and marketplaces from a single location, and best of all, an embedded checkout experience that takes on PCI compliance and customer security on your behalf.<\/p>\n<h4>Quick Start!<\/h4>\n<p>Look at details from the latest release, including new features and enhancements here: https:\/\/github.com\/bigcommerce\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\/releases<\/p>\n<p>Dive into how you set up and customize your site using BC4WP using our guides here: https:\/\/developer.bigcommerce.com\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\/getting-started\/introduction<\/p>\n<p>Have a suggestion for how we can be better? Ping the team! wordpress-suggestions@bigcommerce.com<\/p>\n<h4>DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TRADITIONAL PLUGIN<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve taken a very different approach to ecommerce in WordPress. We set out to build our plugin the WordPress Way: deliver value to the community, build it with WordPress experts and make something developers can call their own.<\/p>\n<p>The BigCommerce for WordPress plugin leverages the best aspects of both platforms, allowing WordPress to manage content and BigCommerce to manage ecommerce.<\/p>\n<h4>SCALABLE ECOMMERCE FOR WORDPRESS<\/h4>\n<p>Continue to tap into the unrestricted customization of WordPress while pairing it with the most scalable SaaS ecommerce engine. BigCommerce lets you build complex catalogs, manage large volumes of concurrent traffic, orders and analytics.<\/p>\n<p>The BigCommerce plugin ports over a copy of your product catalog and stores products as custom post types in WordPress. It also creates pages for your cart, checkout, account profiles, sign in, shipping &amp; returns, gift certificates and order history.<\/p>\n<p>The key difference to our approach is that you don\u2019t need to install additional extensions to get access to common ecommerce features. Instead, you get instant access to many common (and advanced) features, such as complex catalog support, global payment gateways, currency handling, taxation, shipping calculations and centralized channel management; all out-of-the-box.<\/p>\n<h4>OFFLOAD BACKEND RESOURCES<\/h4>\n<p>Our philosophy is that processing orders and running your store shouldn&#8217;t affect the uptime and speed of your site \u2014 which can hurt your SEO, conversion, and brand. The BigCommerce plugin does the heavy commerce lifting, letting you scale your ecommerce without losing speed or uptime.<\/p>\n<h4>LET US HANDLE PCI COMPLIANCE<\/h4>\n<p>Taking on your own PCI compliance comes with a huge amount of liability and risk. BigCommerce powers the full checkout experience, assuming the burden of PCI compliance for you.<\/p>\n<h4>EXTENSIVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce has over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/payments\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">65 payment gateway integrations<\/a> available out-of-the box, serving 100+ countries and over 250 local payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>To help you reduce costs, we\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/paypal-rates\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-negotiated special credit and debit card processing rates with PayPal<\/a>, our preferred payment solution. The more you grow with BigCommerce and upgrade your plan, the lower your rates can go.<\/p>\n<h4>HIGHLY SCALABLE PRODUCT CATALOG<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce is built for large, complex catalogs with up to 600 SKUs per product, and 250 product values for a single option. Our native catalog structure treats single products (including variants, details, SKUs, etc.) as a single API call, making inventory syncing with ERPs, PIMs (and WordPress) fast.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL SELLING &amp; MANAGEMENT<\/h4>\n<p>With the core BigCommerce platform, you now have access within the control panel to sell across multiple marketplaces simultaneously, such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, Square and more! Save time and eliminate errors and overselling with bulk listing, automatic inventory syncing and unified order and fulfillment management.<\/p>\n<h4>USE YOUR FAVORITE WORDPRESS THEME<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress will work with any WordPress theme, but it may require some styling to make it fit perfectly. Are you a theme developer? We\u2019d love to promote your BigCommerce for WordPress compatible theme. <a href=\"mailto:&#x74;&#111;&#112;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;.&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x6f;&#x73;&#105;&#097;&#x40;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x6d;&#x65;&#114;c&#x65;&#046;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#063;s&#x75;&#098;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#061;&#x57;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x50;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#x73;&#037;2&#x30;&#084;&#104;&#x65;&#x6d;&#101;%&#x32;&#048;&#068;&#x65;&#x76;&#101;&#108;&#x6f;&#x70;&#101;&#x72;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch with us here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To start, we recommend choosing a cross-browser compatible WordPress ecommerce theme, since the theme options included will better match what an online store requires.<\/p>\n<h4>ECOMMERCE WITH GUTENBERG<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019re big supporters of Gutenberg and built our plugin to support both the classic editor and Gutenberg. Whether you\u2019re inserting shortcodes in classic mode or product blocks in Gutenberg, we will continue to enable support for both.<\/p>\n<h4>SECURED USER ACCOUNTS &amp; LOGINS<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to offering you peace of mind with a secure checkout experience, we also extend this level of security to your shoppers, their accounts and logins, and payment information \u2014 all managed by BigCommerce.<\/p>\n<h4>GLOBAL SHIPPING STREAMLINED<\/h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/s\/article\/Shipping-Setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support<\/a> all major global carriers, offer real-time carrier quotes, allow for free shipping, flat rates, dropshipping and more. With our deep ShipperHQ integration, you can even specify rates by product, category, customer group, quantity, destination, dimensions and more.<\/p>\n<h4>FLEXIBLE SHOPPING CART<\/h4>\n<p>We are bringing over a decade of focusing on building online stores to every WordPress website. Through this we bring our flexible shopping cart, along with it&#8217;s extensive customization options, so can offer enterprise grade promotions and discounts within a fully responsive layout, without additional extensions that other WordPress ecommerce plugins require.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTIPLE SITES; ONE CONTROL PANEL<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you sell across multiple WordPress sites, you shouldn&#8217;t have to manage them all in separate places. BigCommerce gives you a single control panel to manage your catalog, orders and shipping, all from one place. Streamline your admin experience and spend less time managing ecommerce on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond WordPress, the endpoints we\u2019ve opened on our platform allow you to build commerce into any sort of experience. Looking to launch a site in React? Interested in developing a mobile app? Want to integrate with an in-house POS? <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.bigcommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All of these can be built<\/a> and managed from within the BigCommerce Control Panel.<\/p>\n<h4>COMPLEX ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS INTEGRATIONS<\/h4>\n<p>A huge benefit of having a SaaS ecommerce engine behind the scenes is that the core platform is already built for mid-market and enterprise use cases. Natively connect to your existing ERP suites, PIM software, OMS solutions, POS systems or marketing automation tools right out of the box.<\/p>\n<h4>AMP SUPPORT<\/h4>\n<p>Unique to most WordPress ecommerce plugins, BigCommerce for WordPress also includes support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To activate, install the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/amp\/\" rel=\"ugc\">official Google plugin<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>SUPPORT AND SERVICES<\/h4>\n<p>All of our BigCommerce customers have access to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/features\/247-support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">24\/7<\/a> live phone, chat, and email support, run from our headquarters in Austin, Texas. For larger enterprise customers, we offer dedicated account management and implementation management services as part of your plan. We also have an ever-growing collection of help, support, and how-to guides in our <a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/s\/article\/BigCommerce-for-WordPress-Resources\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>BUILT WITH DEVELOPERS IN MIND<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress was built by WordPress developers, with developers in mind. Our plugin is open source and available for you to fork, extend and modify as your needs require.<\/p>\n<p>Our plugin supports WordPress\u2019 standard method of overriding template files so you can modify out-of-the-box designs. Customize your product cards, lists and shopping cart without risking plugin updates that will undo your changes.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, there are many <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.bigcommerce.com\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\/extending-the-plugin\/code-reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hooks and filters<\/a>, so you can manipulate content to your heart\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<h4>JOIN OUR BIGCOMMERCE COMMUNITY<\/h4>\n<p>All BigCommerce customers get access to our ever-growing online <a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/s\/community\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">community<\/a> to answer questions, discuss ecommerce strategies, learn about the latest product updates, contribute ideas and more.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in contributing to BigCommerce for WordPress, head over to our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bigcommerce\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository<\/a>.<\/p>\n",

We moved a large E-commerce site to Big Commerce for WordPress and I really wished I had known these points before doing this so I hope this post will save someone the pain. Firstly do not attempt this without a very good developer who can work the way around an API as you will need to put hacks in place to get everything working. \n\n1. If you have more than 500 products and need to update these on a regular basis and stock changes then this is not for you. We have 9000 and the syncs take forever constantly fail even with a massive server and you usually need to keep your computer on overnight with the page open or it fails even more. If you do not update the plugin on an update for a day or so and you do full sync you can loose 80% of your products out of WordPress and your whole site starts to 404. Re-installing the plugin does not fix this as suggested and neither does syncing site URL. \n\n2.Web hooks for stock updates do not work properly for stock. You really need to do a full product sync to make sure the stock updates on the front end which means a painful long sync every single day which fails on a regular basis. Web hooks do update the stock but usually it takes 3-4 days for it to update. The good part even if Big Commerce has zero and it says in stock on the front end you can block the customer from buying if they add to cart as it pulls the data from BC. \n\n3. Google Enhanced E-commerce tracking does not work and you will need to put a hack in place. The team are working on a solution but nothing has come out. \n\n4. Meta's for category pages do not pull through. We had to build a custom API solution to get this to work. \n\nI really wish there was some honestly with this plugin and it is advised for people with large complex product data basis this is not the right solution. I can see the benefits if you have a small product database but really is a poor headless solution compared to what is out there on the market. The main problem is this is a product sync from BC to WP and not an API solution. Big Commerce code is also heavy compared to competitors and the performance is just not there for speed either\n\nIf you are looking for a headless solution look at Big Commerce &amp; Shopify with Next.js with a CMS like sanity or Strapi. These are API driven and not a product sync which removes the pain. If you compare speed between both Shopify and Big Commerce sites running this Shopify is faster as a backend platform and Big Commerce code does seem to slow things down however I really like the Big Commerce back end for large cataloges and has some really nice features. As mentioned customer support are great and always try to help. \n\nMy mistake has been made here and I need to deal with it which will probably mean another migration in 2 years unless a better sync solution is put in place. I do see the updates on Github constantly have sync updates included but this has not been thought through for large catalogues and until you are fairly committed and too far down the line to pull out you do not realise how poor it is for large catalogues.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works as intended<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gataf\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/33c153102715b7bbaf934c670827b9e8?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/33c153102715b7bbaf934c670827b9e8?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/gataf\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">gataf<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 19, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is a great alternative for using BigCommerce as your eCommerce platform. It is developer friendly and has a great support team. While it has its limitations, it's not of the plugin's fault. Things such as the embedded checkout (CORS issues) or product importing (server timeouts) are items that are out of the plugin's control. These issues are easily avoided by using the same domain for your BC site and limiting the products displayed on the site (I think the limit is like 500).\n\nAll-in-all, if you use BigCommerce and develop in WordPress, this is a great tool to bridge the two platforms.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Mess up my site badly<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/leipsyart\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0554aa01290567aa9c34edce52599037?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/0554aa01290567aa9c34edce52599037?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/leipsyart\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">leipsyart<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 16, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I do not enjoy leaving bad comments to other business. But other WP users like me would need honest review before they install this plugin.\n\nFirstly, I'd give great compliments, 100 stars if I could, to the CS service of the BigCommerce site. He spent up to two hours to explain me how BigCommerce and this plugin work as a WP beginner. Although he wasn't tech support, I explained him that I follow the step of the plugin to seek help...he was willing to help and asked for his colleagues and therefore our phone spent over two hours....\n\nHowever, this plugin suck! And mess up my site badly. I am on free trial of BigCommerce and considered using them instead. Indeed, I don't need this plugin. But I don't find clear instructions on the plugin. It was a mistake to use it. Also, the plugin doesn't work even thought the CS staff worked with me through their company instruction. I am using the latest version of WP which isn't tested by this plugin. At last, it messed up my site set up: Pictures, menu setting, backup function on this site. I am unable to restore the back up on WP. The backup on my hosting site appeared to have problems since the same day I use this plugin. Luckily, my hosting company has stored the backup right before the day I installed this plugin and I can restore it!\n\nTerrible experience.

The client had a BigC store and two other WP content sites.  They wanted a unified e-store + content site.  \n\nIt wasn't a perfect experience.  BC4WP has some gaps in desired functionality, but they seem to be continually improviing the plugin.  Developers from the WP\/Woocommerce world will have to cope with learning some new approaches, but the basics you need for delivering a rich e-commerce + rich content experience are here, and it's far easier to work with than the BigC backend CMS.\n\nBottom line:  BC4WP opens up a world of rich content possibilities for existing BigC stores, and on that basis alone, it is worth serious consideration.  For new stores, the reasons are a bit less compelling but still very worthwhile.  You get all of the solidness of BigC's back end ... shipping, payment, analytics, with the rich front-end capabilities of WordPress and your favorite themes and plugins.\n\nBig shout out to Topher in the BC4WP Slack community, who is a powerful champion for this plugin.  He's an excellent resource.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Plugin does not work, too many issues<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/vervexart\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e1df1470fc45d5373a5409f5492b3833?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/e1df1470fc45d5373a5409f5492b3833?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/vervexart\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">vervexart<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">February 3, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><strong>Updated Review:<\/strong> I previously wrote a positive review of this plugin before I got it working as I had faith in the team behind BigCommerce for WordPress to help me. This assistance didn't last long. The plugin ultimately failed after an update back in October and my client's site was unusable as a result. This was a monumental failure. Do not recommend, very disappointed by BigCommerce and their team. \n\n<strong>Previous Review:<\/strong> Long story short: My client picked BigCommerce as her ecommerce platform of choice after speaking with sales agents. While it wasn't our first choice, we went ahead and agreed to build an ecommerce using BigCommerce for WordPress. After installing this plugin and working with it for a while, we uncovered some amount of frustrating challenges \/ kinks, including links in product descriptions not being automatically synced, checkout not always working right, and incompatibility with some translation plugins we're used to work with (WPML is one for instance). \n\nWe tried email support but the responses we got were usually vague and borderline unhelpful. We had to take to Twitter to make our grievances public. And then came Topher, BigCommerce superstar employee, the developer who'll go the extra mile to get your issues fixed. He helped us work out most of the kinks we couldn't resolve on our own, and now checkout's working fine, he showed us how to reset products to get links working again (alright, so, it's weird that we have to manually reset the products to import links but... at least it works?). Translating the store is the last thing we're working on right now.\n\nIs BigCommerce for WordPress a perfect plugin? No, it's not. That being said, after spending a lot of time working with their support team, we see what BigCommerce has to offer and that this could become an amazing plugin someday, maybe even a perfect plugin, if they keep working at it. 5 stars for Topher. 3 stars for BigCommerce for WP.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Solid, extensible and well maintained<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/benbutterfield\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/45c3de3c48b7db7559cd75a65216a1b9?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/45c3de3c48b7db7559cd75a65216a1b9?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/benbutterfield\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Ben Butterfield <small>(BenButterfield)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">September 11, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">In my experience, this plugin has been solid, extensible and well maintained.

The biggest thing was that I could not hook into JS events such as when products were initialized on page load or when the quick view dialog was triggered.\n\nBesides that, I was quite impressed with the backend and their decoupled approach. There were a lot of templates and also a lot of hooks. Furthermore, their developer support (not customer) is amazing: working with Topher, the BigCommerce WordPress Developer Evangelist, was a pleasure.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"

    "description": "<p>BigCommerce for WordPress is a plugin that allows you to scale ecommerce further than ever before on WordPress. Scale your business with WordPress on the front-end and free up server resources from things like catalog management, processing payments, managing fulfillment logistics and more with BigCommerce on the back end.<\/p>\n<p>Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, you get access to our native ecommerce features from a single plugin, the ability to sell across multiple channels and marketplaces from a single location, and best of all, an embedded checkout experience that takes on PCI compliance and customer security on your behalf.<\/p>\n<h4>Quick Start!<\/h4>\n<p>Look at details from the latest release, including new features and enhancements here: https:\/\/github.com\/bigcommerce\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\/releases<\/p>\n<p>Dive into how you set up and customize your site using BC4WP using our guides here: https:\/\/developer.bigcommerce.com\/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\/getting-started\/introduction<\/p>\n<p>Have a suggestion for how we can be better? Ping the team! wordpress-suggestions@bigcommerce.com<\/p>\n<h4>DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TRADITIONAL PLUGIN<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve taken a very different approach to ecommerce in WordPress. We set out to build our plugin the WordPress Way: deliver value to the community, build it with WordPress experts and make something developers can call their own.<\/p>\n<p>The BigCommerce for WordPress plugin leverages the best aspects of both platforms, allowing WordPress to manage content and BigCommerce to manage ecommerce.<\/p>\n<h4>SCALABLE ECOMMERCE FOR WORDPRESS<\/h4>\n<p>Continue to tap into the unrestricted customization of WordPress while pairing it with the most scalable SaaS ecommerce engine. BigCommerce lets you build complex catalogs, manage large volumes of concurrent traffic, orders and analytics.<\/p>\n<p>The BigCommerce plugin ports over a copy of your product catalog and stores products as custom post types in WordPress. It also creates pages for your cart, checkout, account profiles, sign in, shipping &amp; returns, gift certificates and order history.<\/p>\n<p>The key difference to our approach is that you don\u2019t need to install additional extensions to get access to common ecommerce features. Instead, you get instant access to many common (and advanced) features, such as complex catalog support, global payment gateways, currency handling, taxation, shipping calculations and centralized channel management; all out-of-the-box.<\/p>\n<h4>OFFLOAD BACKEND RESOURCES<\/h4>\n<p>Our philosophy is that processing orders and running your store shouldn&#8217;t affect the uptime and speed of your site \u2014 which can hurt your SEO, conversion, and brand. The BigCommerce plugin does the heavy commerce lifting, letting you scale your ecommerce without losing speed or uptime.<\/p>\n<h4>LET US HANDLE PCI COMPLIANCE<\/h4>\n<p>Taking on your own PCI compliance comes with a huge amount of liability and risk. BigCommerce powers the full checkout experience, assuming the burden of PCI compliance for you.<\/p>\n<h4>EXTENSIVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce has over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/payments\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">65 payment gateway integrations<\/a> available out-of-the box, serving 100+ countries and over 250 local payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>To help you reduce costs, we\u2019ve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/paypal-rates\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-negotiated special credit and debit card processing rates with PayPal<\/a>, our preferred payment solution. The more you grow with BigCommerce and upgrade your plan, the lower your rates can go.<\/p>\n<h4>HIGHLY SCALABLE PRODUCT CATALOG<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce is built for large, complex catalogs with up to 600 SKUs per product, and 250 product values for a single option. Our native catalog structure treats single products (including variants, details, SKUs, etc.) as a single API call, making inventory syncing with ERPs, PIMs (and WordPress) fast.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL SELLING &amp; MANAGEMENT<\/h4>\n<p>With the core BigCommerce platform, you now have access within the control panel to sell across multiple marketplaces simultaneously, such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, Square and more! Save time and eliminate errors and overselling with bulk listing, automatic inventory syncing and unified order and fulfillment management.<\/p>\n<h4>USE YOUR FAVORITE WORDPRESS THEME<\/h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress will work with any WordPress theme, but it may require some styling to make it fit perfectly. Are you a theme developer? We\u2019d love to promote your BigCommerce for WordPress compatible theme. <a href=\"mailto:&#x74;&#111;&#112;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;.&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x6f;&#x73;&#105;&#097;&#x40;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x6d;&#x65;&#114;c&#x65;&#046;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#063;s&#x75;&#098;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#061;&#x57;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x50;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#x73;&#037;2&#x30;&#084;&#104;&#x65;&#x6d;&#101;%&#x32;&#048;&#068;&#x65;&#x76;&#101;&#108;&#x6f;&#x70;&#101;&#x72;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch with us here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To start, we recommend choosing a cross-browser compatible WordPress ecommerce theme, since the theme options included will better match what an online store requires.<\/p>\n<h4>ECOMMERCE WITH GUTENBERG<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019re big supporters of Gutenberg and built our plugin to support both the classic editor and Gutenberg. Whether you\u2019re inserting shortcodes in classic mode or product blocks in Gutenberg, we will continue to enable support for both.<\/p>\n<h4>SECURED USER ACCOUNTS &amp; LOGINS<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to offering you peace of mind with a secure checkout experience, we also extend this level of security to your shoppers, their accounts and logins, and payment information \u2014 all managed by BigCommerce.<\/p>\n<h4>GLOBAL SHIPPING STREAMLINED<\/h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/s\/article\/Shipping-Setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support<\/a> all major global carriers, offer real-time carrier quotes, allow for free shipping, flat rates, dropshipping and more. With our deep ShipperHQ integration, you can even specify rates by product, category, customer group, quantity, destination, dimensions and more.<\/p>\n<h4>FLEXIBLE SHOPPING CART<\/h4>\n<p>We are bringing over a decade of focusing on building online stores to every WordPress website. Through this we bring our flexible shopping cart, along with it&#8217;s extensive customization options, so can offer enterprise grade promotions and discounts within a fully responsive layout, without additional extensions that other WordPress ecommerce plugins require.<\/p>\n<h4>MULTIPLE SITES; ONE CONTROL PANEL<\/h4>\n<p>Even if you sell across multiple WordPress sites, you shouldn&#8217;t have to manage them all in separate places. BigCommerce gives you a single control panel to manage your catalog, orders and shipping, all from one place. Streamline your admin experience and spend less time managing ecommerce on WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond WordPress, the endpoints we\u2019ve opened on our platform allow you to build commerce into any sort of experience. Looking to launch a site in React? Interested in developing a mobile app? Want to integrate with an in-house POS? <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.bigcommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All of these can be built<\/a> and managed from within the BigCommerce Control Panel.<\/p>\n<h4>COMPLEX ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS INTEGRATIONS<\/h4>\n<p>A huge benefit of having a SaaS ecommerce engine behind the scenes is that the core platform is already built for mid-market and enterprise use cases. Natively connect to your existing ERP suites, PIM software, OMS solutions, POS systems or marketing automation tools right out of the box.<\/p>\n<h4>AMP SUPPORT<\/h4>\n<p>Unique to most WordPress ecommerce plugins, BigCommerce for WordPress also includes support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To activate, install the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/amp\/\" rel=\"ugc\">official Google plugin<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>SUPPORT AND SERVICES<\/h4>\n<p>All of our BigCommerce customers have access to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/features\/247-support\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">24\/7<\/a> live phone, chat, and email support, run from our headquarters in Austin, Texas.
