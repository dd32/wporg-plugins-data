Competing plugins or services are incredibly expensive with some requiring an exorbitant payment per user which becomes out of reach for smaller businesses or entrepreneurs trying to make a start. With Support Genix I have unlimited users, the ability to categorise tickets, email pipe tickets from users to the system, search within tickets, receive ticket notifications, assign users to a ticket and all tickets are logged and time stamped. These are just some of the features they deliver, with more value adds on the way with user feedback, I am sure. All in all, very impressed with the professionalism and eagerness of the team to help with any technical queries or feature requests. Highly recommend this plugin to Wordpress developers or basic users and to really consider the extra value adds of the super affordable pro version of this plugin.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
