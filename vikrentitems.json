The same powerful and experienced framework is now at the service of all webmasters, designers and web-agencies that work with WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>The main differences with its brother plugin &#8220;Vik Rent Car&#8221; is that Vik Rent Items allows to book multiple items with the same order, also with multiple quantities if the items allow the choice of the units to book.<\/p>\n<p>No matter if you want to rent small or large items, in single or multiple quantities, for short or long terms (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly), Vik Rent Items will fulfill all your needs.<\/p>\n<p>This is the <strong>free<\/strong> version of the plugin, but you can upgrade to the <strong>Pro<\/strong> version at any time from your <em>wp-admin<\/em> section.

You are free to install Vik Rent Items on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20main%20difference%20with%20vik%20rent%20car%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the main difference with Vik Rent Car?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many functions of Vik Rent Items and Vik Rent Car are pretty similar. However, the biggest difference is that with Vik Rent Items you can allow your clients to rent multiple items (for the same dates) with the same order, as well as items with multiple units. Vik Rent Car instead was mainly designed for vehicles, where, for example, only one car per order could be rented. If you need to allow a family to book multiple bycycle with one single order, maybe 2 &#8220;Mountain Bikes&#8221; and 3 &#8220;Bikes for Kids&#8221;, then Vik Rent Items will work perfectly. This is also a plugin designed for generic items, not specifically for vehicles, and so it can adjust to literally any kind of items, things or objects for rent.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
