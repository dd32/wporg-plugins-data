        "description": "<p>Caching is great for scenarios where your post or page content it&#8217;s not changed frequently, but if you have a form embedded to which you do changes very often or you&#8217;re using dynamic code, that doesn&#8217;t run for a cached page, or using third-party solutions relaying in dynamic live data (e.g. reCAPTCHA), using caching in these cases is going to cause issues. The same applies to certain automatic JS optimizations done by caching plugins that are known to break JS execution easily.<\/p>\n<p>An easy solution is to configure your caching plugin or proxy to exclude the page where the form is embedded, but you need also to remember this when you create a new page or embed a new form in an existing page&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will take care of the above automatically doing the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Flush current cache on plugin activation. This is <strong>required<\/strong> in order to allow the next step to run.<\/li>\n<li>Dynamically check if there&#8217;s a Gravity Forms for any of the supported embedding methods (see below for the list).<\/li>\n<li>If so, it will prevent post\/page from being cached by any of the supported caching plugins, browsers and CDN\/Proxies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Embedding methods supported:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress default editor, shortcode or Gutenberg block<\/strong>.

You can also make Fresh Forms to add a cookie when a form is detected to use this cookie as a way to skip caching for hosts using Varnish based caching. Please see FAQ for more details.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no options page. Only the plugin version is saved to the database to be able to handle actions after an update when needed, <strong>no other data is stored<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It should work with any caching plugin with support for DONOTCACHEPAGE constant, and proxies respecting the use Cache-Control HTTP header.<\/p>\n<p>Caching and Optimization plugins <strong>supported<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autoptimize<\/li>\n<li>Cache Enabler<\/li>\n<li>Comet Cache<\/li>\n<li>Hummingbird<\/li>\n<li>Kinsta Cache<\/li>\n<li>LiteSpeed Cache<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/page-optimize\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Page Optimize<\/a> (Script concatenation only)<\/li>\n<li>Perfmatters (Delay JS exclusions only)<\/li>\n<li>Speed Optimizer (by SiteGround, the plugin with more name changes in the history of WordPress!)<\/li>\n<li>Surge<\/li>\n<li>W3 Total Cache<\/li>\n<li>WP Engine System<\/li>\n<li>WP Fastest Cache<\/li>\n<li>WP Optimize<\/li>\n<li>WP Rocket<\/li>\n<li>WP Super Cache<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Caching plugins <strong>NOT supported<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Breeze.

It doesn&#8217;t support DONOTCACHEPAGE constant or filters to skip caching. <strong>Check FAQ for a workaround.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cloudflare and other CDN\/proxies:<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will add appropriate HTTP header to pages with a Gravity Forms form to exlude the page HTML from caching when the web host setup allows it.<\/p>\n<p>By default Cloudflare doesn&#8217;t cache the page HTML, it does only when you have configured it to &#8220;Cache Everything&#8221;. In this case, after activating the plugin, you need to purge cache in your Cloudflare account or wait for cache expiration to let Cloudflare know the page must be excluded from caching.<\/p>\n<p>Certain hosts like <strong>WP Engine and Kinsta don&#8217;t allow HTTP headers modification from WordPress side of things<\/strong>, therefore Cloudflare support will not work for these hosts.<\/p>\n<p>Other proxy services should work in a similar way, but I don&#8217;t have access to test any other proxy service. Feel to reach me if you want to provide me access to add support for your proxy service (documentation for the proxy would be required).<\/p>\n<p>Note for these cases (caching is done by an external service), Fresh Forms can just include the HTTP header when your web host allows it. Once the header is added, it&#8217;s up to the CDN\/proxy being used to obey the header and skip caching for the page.<\/p>\n<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 7.0 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 4.9 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>Gravity Forms 2.3 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>Only forms embedded using classic editor shortcode or Gutenberg block are supported.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<p>Just install and activate, no settings page.<\/p>\n",

If you have a WordPress installed to manage Varnish cache and this plugin has support for the DONOTCACHEPAGE constant, Fresh Forms should work out of the box.<\/p>\n<p>But there are some WordPress plugins, like Breeze by CloudWays and NitroPack, that while they are created to integrate WordPress with Varnish, they don&#8217;t support DONOTCACHEPAGE or provide any WordPress filters to exclude content dynamically (at the time of writing this).<\/p>\n<p>But both have support to exclude pages from their cache based on a cookie added. Since Fresh Forms 1.3.4, you can use the freshforms_add_cookie filter in your theme functions.php file or a custom fucntionatliy plugin to make Fresh Forms to add a cookie that you can configure in CloudWays or NitroPack account dashboard.<\/p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'freshforms_add_cookie', '__return_true' );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Once you have the filter added to your site, follow the instructions below.<\/p>\n<p>CloudWays documentation: <a href=\"https:\/\/support.cloudways.com\/how-to-include-or-exclude-cookies-from-varnish\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Include or Exclude Cookies From Varnish<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you select <strong>Exclude<\/strong> for the Method, and use <strong>FreshForms<\/strong> for the cookie Value.<\/p>\n<p>NitroPack documentation:  <a href=\"https:\/\/support.nitropack.io\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/1500002527202-Excluded-Cookies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Excluded Cookies<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Use <strong>FreshForms<\/strong> for the Cookie Name and <strong>no-cache<\/strong> for the Cookie Values.<\/p>\n<p>After doing the above, you need to <strong>flush your host and browser cache<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

It solves many Gravity Forms issues caused when minifying JS files via a cache plugin.\n\nPrior to installing this plugin, we had to use both SG Optimizer and WP Rocket to solve our Gravity Forms issue. Thanks to this plugin, however, we only have to use one cache plugin. In our case, we decided to stick with SG Optimizer.\n\nJob well done.

This plugin saved me a ton of headaches and is now living on all the sites where I have Gravity Forms installed - for god's sake, sell this little sucker. Genius. This is just genius. You may want to consider the pricing model the One Dollar Plugin guy uses, $1 per month, $12 per year. This makes it affordable for the very little guys.\n\nSecond, just a good ol' fashioned THANK YOU!\n\nYou get the hero of my day award. Seriously. The awards' not worth a damn thing but you got it anyhow.\n\nA sure fan here!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"

    "short_description": "Exclude pages from cache when a Gravity Forms shortcode or block is detected. Also deals with issues caused by some automatic JS optimizations.",
    "description": "<p>Caching is great for scenarios where your post or page content it&#8217;s not changed frequently, but if you have a form embedded to which you do changes very often or you&#8217;re using dynamic code, that doesn&#8217;t run for a cached page, or using third-party solutions relaying in dynamic live data (e.g. reCAPTCHA), using caching in these cases is going to cause issues. The same applies to certain automatic JS optimizations done by caching plugins that are known to break JS execution easily.<\/p>\n<p>An easy solution is to configure your caching plugin or proxy to exclude the page where the form is embedded, but you need also to remember this when you create a new page or embed a new form in an existing page&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>This plugin will take care of the above automatically doing the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Flush current cache on plugin activation. This is <strong>required<\/strong> in order to allow the next step to run.<\/li>\n<li>Dynamically check if there&#8217;s a Gravity Forms for any of the supported embedding methods (see below for the list).<\/li>\n<li>If so, it will prevent post\/page from being cached by any of the supported caching plugins, browsers and CDN\/Proxies.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Embedding methods supported:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress default editor, shortcode or Gutenberg block<\/strong>.

In this case, after activating the plugin, you need to purge cache in your Cloudflare account or wait for cache expiration to let Cloudflare know the page must be excluded from caching.<\/p>\n<p>Certain hosts like <strong>WP Engine and Kinsta don&#8217;t allow HTTP headers modification from WordPress side of things<\/strong>, therefore Cloudflare support will not work for these hosts.<\/p>\n<p>Other proxy services should work in a similar way, but I don&#8217;t have access to test any other proxy service. Feel to reach me if you want to provide me access to add support for your proxy service (documentation for the proxy would be required).<\/p>\n<p>Note for these cases (caching is done by an external service), Fresh Forms can just include the HTTP header when your web host allows it. Once the header is added, it&#8217;s up to the CDN\/proxy being used to obey the header and skip caching for the page.<\/p>\n<h4>Requirements<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 7.0 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress 4.9 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>Gravity Forms 2.3 or higher.<\/li>\n<li>Only forms embedded using classic editor shortcode or Gutenberg block are supported.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Usage<\/h4>\n<p>Just install and activate, no settings page.<\/p>\n",
