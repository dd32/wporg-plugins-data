As a side effect the <code>af_success<\/code> URL parameter is no longer necessary!<\/li>\n<li>Added <code>target<\/code> attribute and helper function <code>af_has_submission<\/code>.

As developer, I often had to customize forms\u2026 this always was a struggle with Caldera Forms, but worked\u2026\n\nAnd lately a user of its successor Ninja Forms (Pro)\u2026 Unfortunately, Ninja Forms doesn't stand to its advertising\u2026 support, quality..\n\nBecause of the general very high quality of ACF I always wanted to switch to ACF based forms, but hesitated because of ACF itself. (I'm a long term user of ACF pro too and using it in nearly every project).\n\nThe <strong>problem<\/strong> with ACF is its quite \"end user unfriendly\" and very technical UI\u2026 \n\nBut after another frustrating project using Ninja Forms, I bit the bullet and switched to Advanced Forms (Pro) and Advanced Custom Fields Pro.\n\nAnd I only regret not to have done this earlier. The pros just outweigh the cons multiple times\u2026\n\n(To admit: I currently only use it in projects where the end user has not to work with the forms directly. This might be a problem in the future, but maybe not.)<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">AF Pro enabled our advanced intake system<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/neuromorph\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88456d40a310b744007f377ed03a3366?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/88456d40a310b744007f377ed03a3366?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/neuromorph\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">neuromorph<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 3, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Advanced Forms Pro is an essential component to our patient and animal intake system \u2013 a system which integrates Acuity Scheduling, WordPress-ACF, Zapier and Google Workspace apps. \n\nAF Pro's API is used to pre-fill ACF form fields with URL query string values initially generated in Acuity. After that, AF Pro's Zapier API passes to Google raw field values, and computed values, which populate placeholders inside a G-Doc template. Then, automatically created Workspace folders receive new intake G-Docs derived from the populated templates. The folders also receive image files passed to Google via AF Pro's Zapier integration.\n\nLargely thanks to AF Pro, and Fabian's outstanding tech support, I was able to pull this whole thing off. My client is absolutely over-the-moon at all the functionality and subsequent tremendous time savings the system is providing them. \n\nThank you!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Excellent addition to ACF ecosystem<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/h2o1torben\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6396d628cf3c0d8ebd56d37a5c66257d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6396d628cf3c0d8ebd56d37a5c66257d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/h2o1torben\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">drl <small>(h2o1torben)<\/small><\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 5, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">This is a really useful set of tools for those of us who rely on ACF.

It's used for registered users to submit events (Custom Post Type), which then will be marked as pending and an email is sent to the revisor for approval.\n\nI couldn't find any other Form-Plugin plugin that met all of the special requirements, and was about code the form myself.
