I really like that this plugin is open source and free for regular functionality, and you can pay more if you want more advanced features. It is also great for collecting information and keeping it on your own server so you \"own\" your own info. It's also been great for low-income not-for-profits I volunteer for and I'm excited to get a more advanced project to try out the paid version on. Thanks, Civist! <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
