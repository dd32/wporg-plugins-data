It bridges a rather large gap between completely preconfigured form plugins that lack essential fields, and more complex plugins that are very difficult for beginners to figure out. \n\nThe built-in preview of the form as you are building is very helpful, and it has a really nice range of field type options and style settings, which are named in a more user-friendly way than most. Also, the drag and drop works smoothly and easily without any funky bugginess. \n\nIt does indeed take its style from the theme, which is great if custom styling is a little over your head, though you can tweak things like border (or not) easily without needing any special knowledge. You can create a custom message for a successful form submission, or redirect to a specific page. I was particularly intrigued by the option (on Send Options tab) to allow submission of the form to create a new WordPress user, which could be handy if you are offering private content in exchange for signups. \n\nI tested the form, and the notification email came in very promptly. As well as receiving them via email, you can review submissions in your Dashboard under Messages (though the enormous \"upgrade to Pro\" button in this section is a bit overwhelming). \n\nAbout the only thing it lacks is the ability to import\/export settings. This would be great for sending preconfigured settings to some of my more technically challenged clients. But that's not a complaint. This a very generously-featured plugin as it is. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Wow!

There are several contact form plugins but I didn't like most of them. Then I found Quick contact form. Wow!\n\nIt was very easy to set up and it just worked! It worked on my development website which was on a test domain with different website address (this is where contact form 7 gave issues). It worked seamlessly when the site was migrated to its final home. \n\nIt offers tons of customization, styling options. It is simple and clean. I just wish that there was one more option where the label for a field could be shown outside of the field text box. It's inside the box by default and cannot be changed. Not a big deal but would love to have that flexibility.
