And two, you may need some custom CSS to style\/size it.<\/p>\n<p>The Premium way: When you check the Media Tag option, it creates and includes the Media:Content block, and then in Mailchimp you can use the RSSITEM:IMAGE merge tag, and place the image wherever you like, create custom designs, etc. Those same two caveats apply, non-https websites may not show the images in Preview Mode but should work when sent, and custom CSS is even more desirable, which we can help with, and which is why it&#8217;s a Premium option.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='blurry%20images%20in%20mailchimp%20or%20other%20services'>\nBlurry images in Mailchimp or other Services\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Blurry images usually means the size selected in the plugin&#8217;s option page is too small. Try increasing it, or using &#8220;Full&#8221; size. If still blurry using Full, then the original image size uploaded is too small, upload a larger image.<\/p>\n<p>The other option is to use some custom CSS to display the image(s) smaller in the email, max width should always be 600px for Mailchimp, so make sure your images are at least that large, and ideally exactly that width, with a reasonable height (300-500px typically).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='free%20features'>\nFree Features\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Featured image size: Select from thumbnail, medium, large, any theme-specific sizes, and full size.<\/li>\n<li>Image Position: Select Image left above text, Image left text wrap, Image right text wrap, and Image centered above text.<\/li>\n<li>Padding: Instantly set the spacing between the image and the body text.<\/li>\n<li>Feedly: Now support Feedly&#8217;s webfeedsFeaturedVisual class name on image HTML.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='premium%20version%20features'>\nPremium Version Features\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upgrade to the Premium version for a full suite of image customization features for professional marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy a 14-day free trial no credit card required.

It seems that somehow the settings of the plugin were being cached by my caching plugin, which was easily solved for the trial (by clearing the cache), but caused more trouble and persisting issues for the final premium activation. After clearing the cache and trying \"cachebuster\" suggestions by support, re-synching the license, deactivating\/re-activating the plugin, re-installing the plugin, and installing other plugins, the issue finally solved \"automagically\" and disappeared, without being able to find a real culprit (but losing way too much time).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The worst part of the premium plugin is that, even after I paid 70$ for it and upgraded it, I am still constantly seeing three messages from the plugin in the WP backend (one about their affiliate program, one which states \"W00t! Premium plugin version was successfully activated\" and another almost identical message, but in Italian). I closed all three messages way too many times by clicking the \"x\" button (given that there is no \"Don't show this message again\" option), but they keep appearing as soon as I refresh the page.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was hoping to have found the ideal RSS feed image plugin to use on all client sites which need this feature, but unfortuantely I am not sure at all if I will renew their license, or start \"spamming\" other clients websites with such annoying messages. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Concerning the use on multiple websites, it has also to be noted that their bulk pricing structure is not generous at all, their single license is already quite on the high price tier with 70$\/year, but providing a maximum multi-site discount of only 24% (for the maximum of 20 sites) is making it even more disappointing, especially if you see how other providers (even for way more complex and resource-intensive plugins) are offering 50%-90% multi-site discounts.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Summing up, there is still a lot to improve in order to make this a really good plugin. I would expect a more \"one-click\" approach for activating the trial as well as the premium version, and I would especially expect to be able to hide these very annoying messages, starting with the free version but even more in the premium version.

This is a super easy way to customize the featured images that appear in the RSS feed \u2013 no more ugly pre-populated visuals. I especially love the Mailchimp integration. It\u2019s great to have this much control over our content. Image is everything!&#8221; &#8211; @morganmariequinn <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/must-have-for-content-marketing\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Read the review<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Must Have for Featured Image Based Themes &amp; MailChimp Users. For several years my WordPress theme has used featured images at the head of all my posts. The problem is, then, when feeding my RSS feed to MailChimp, that featured image at the head of the post is lost. Sometimes the image is highly crucial to the post (not to mention more enjoyable), so this plugin is a life saver. A must have!&#8221; &#8211; @ericdye <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/must-have-for-featured-image-based-themes-mailchimp-users\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Read the review<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It just works \u2013 lovely! Great with MailChimp. I installed this plugin, changed the (very simple) settings and the featured images started appearing in my MailChimp campaigns straight away \u2013 perfect!&#8221; &#8211; @barn2media <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/it-just-works-lovely-great-with-mailchimp\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Read the review<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>We promise you&#8217;ll love the features this plugin provides for your content marketing automation!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Need help<\/strong> or wish it did something else as well?
