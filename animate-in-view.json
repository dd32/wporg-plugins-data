Yes, I could have searched out a plugin, or created my own classes and remember to add them in, but I never quite got around to it...\n\nThen I saw on WP Tavern a mention of 'Animate in View'. It's great! It does what it says on the tin and in a modern WordPress block way. (Just a word of advice for anyone that uses it, remember to drag your blocks out of the Animate in View wrapper, if you decide not to use it on a certain section, as you can't toggle it on and off, and removing the wrapper from the Block Editor will also remove what's inside).\n\nAnimate in View is now joining my personal collection of handy \"utility\" blocks. Good Work!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
