This has since been fixed, so what follows is a proper review:\n\nVery easy to use and free of complicated options.\n\nThe plugin does what it says it does, it displays a nice little bar at the top of the page for your visitors, or also to back-end users. That's great to have both of those options.\n\nI wish there were style settings though. I can change the text color via CSS, but not the bar background color. The in-line style cannot be overridden, so you are stuck with grey #ccc\n\nPlease add settings to choose:\n- text color\n- background color\n- border color<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
