        "description": "<p>Most broken link checker plugins are not recommended, because they do a full scan of the entire site and can cause performance and timeout issues. Therefore it is recommended to use an offsite service for full site scans. However, this plugin can be used as an additional tool to let you know when someone loads a page with a broken link on it.<\/p>\n<h4>Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No performance lag &#8211; scanning runs in the background after the page loads.<\/li>\n<li>Get notified of broken links via email, Discord, and\/or Microsoft Teams.<\/li>\n<li>Option to omit links, pages, and post types from scans.<\/li>\n<li>Run a detailed scan of a single page on the back-end.<\/li>\n<li>Scan multiple pages at a time on the back-end from your WP List Tables.<\/li>\n<li>Also checks embedded YouTube videos.<\/li>\n<li>Developer hooks available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin from your website&#8217;s plugin directory, or upload the plugin to your plugins folder. <\/li>\n<li>Activate it.<\/li>\n<li>Go to <code>Broken Link Notifier &gt; Settings<\/code> in your admin menu.<\/li>\n<li>Update your notification method(s) and post types.<\/li>\n<li>Go to <code>Broken Link Notifier &gt; Omitted Pages<\/code>, and add any pages that you don&#8217;t want to scan, such as pages you know won&#8217;t have any links on them. This will speed up the multi-scan option.<\/li>\n<li>Page load scans are enabled automatically, so it&#8217;s recommended that you test it out by deliberately making some broken links on a test page and then visiting the page. The results should show up on the <code>Broken Link Notifier &gt; Results<\/code> page, and notify you if you have enabled email, Discord, or Microsoft Teams notifications. Reloading the page will not submit them twice. For testing, you should delete them from the results so they get reported again.<\/li>\n<li>It is suggested to run a Multi-Scan on each of your public-facing post types to quickly -see if there are any broken links before others encounter them. Also to omit some links that will be reported as false positives. You can omit individual links quickly from the results, or you can go to <code>Broken Link Notifier &gt; Omitted Links<\/code> to add a domain with a wildcard (*), which will omit all links starting with that domain. See screenshots for examples.<\/li>\n<li>If you have any questions, please reach out to me on my <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/3HnzNEJVnR\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discord support server<\/a>. I am happy to assist you or fix any issues you might have with the plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",

If it is a redirect on your own site due to permalink modification, then it&#8217;s better to fix the link instead of unnecessarily redirecting. You may use the Omit option to omit false positives from future scans as well. If you are seeing a pattern with a multiple links from the same domain, you can go to <code>Broken Link Notifier &gt; Omitted Links<\/code> to add a domain with a wildcard (*), which will omit all links starting with that domain.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20causes%20a%20link%20to%20give%20a%20warning%3F'>\nWhat causes a link to give a warning?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Warnings mean the link was found, but they may be unsecure or slow to respond. If you are getting too many warnings due to timeouts, try increasing your timeout in Settings. This will just result in longer wait times, but with more accuracy. You can also disable warnings if you have too many of them.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20status%20code%20666%3F'>\nWhat is status code 666?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>A status code of <code>666<\/code> is a code we use to force invalid URL <code>code 0<\/code> to be a broken link in case warnings are disabled. It is not an official status code.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20omit%20links%20and%20pages%20from%20scans%3F'>\nCan I omit links and pages from scans?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can omit links from being checked for validity by using the &#8220;Omit&#8221; link in the scan results, or by entering them in manually under Omitted Links. Likewise, you can omit pages from being scanned from the results page or Omitted Pages. Wildcards (*) are accepted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='when%20i%20click%20on%20%22find%20on%20page%2C%22%20i%20cannot%20find%20the%20link.%20where%20is%20it%3F'>\nWhen I click on &#8220;Find On Page,&#8221; I cannot find the link. Where is it?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes links are hidden with CSS or inside modals\/popups. To find hidden links, go to the page and either open your developer console or view the page source and search for the link. This will show you where it is and which element to look in. Then you can edit the page accordingly. This is more advanced and may require some assistance, so feel free to reach out to me for help.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20dev%20console%20show%20more%20links%20that%20what%20is%20scanned%20on%20the%20multi-scan%3F'>\nWhy does the dev console show more links that what is scanned on the Multi-Scan?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Multi-Scan link count does not include links that are filtered out from the pre-check.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20pre-checks%20are%20used%20to%20filter%20out%20broken%20links%3F'>\nWhat pre-checks are used to filter out broken links?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>We skip links that start with <code>#<\/code> (anchor tags and JavaScript) or <code>?<\/code> (query strings), non-http url schemes (such as <code>mailto:<\/code>, <code>tel:<\/code>, <code>data:<\/code>, etc. ), and any links you have omitted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20do%20if%20i%20have%20the%20same%20broken%20link%20on%20a%20lot%20of%20pages%3F'>\nWhat can I do if I have the same broken link on a lot of pages?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are other plugins such as <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/better-search-replace\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Better Search Replace by WP Engine<\/a> that will quickly replace URLs on your entire site at once.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
