        "description": "<p>With <strong>WooCommerce Clover Payment Gateway<\/strong> you can use your Clover POS to accepts payments from your Woo-Commerce Shop<br \/>\nPage. All you need is a Clover POS to accept payments from your Woo-Commerce \/ WordPress website. Allow customers to<br \/>\nplace orders from your WordPress website and then be notified of the orders on your Clover Pos. Easily manage and<br \/>\nprint the orders as they come in. This plugin is the ideal solution to accept payment through your Clover in less<br \/>\nthan 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<h4>How it works<\/h4>\n<p>After installing the <strong>WooCommerce Clover Payment Gateway<\/strong>, click on payments in Woocommerce settings, then enter the<br \/>\nApi Key. The Api Key is found by going to Clover.com \u201cMore Tools\u201d then install the \u201cSmart Online Order\u201d app. Once<br \/>\ninstalled, open the app to get the Api Key. Copy the Api Key and paste into the Woo-Commerce payment integration.<br \/>\nSee docs.smartonlineorder.com or search Youtube \u201cSmart Online Order Woo Commerce\u201d for tutorials and help.<\/p>\n<p>Please note: This plugin uses the existing inventory from your Woo-Commerce Store Page. It acts as a payment gateway so<br \/>\nthat payments are processed through your Clover POS. It also Auto Prints the orders that comes from your<br \/>\nWoo Commerce website to your Clover POS.<\/p>\n<p>All Orders processed by the Clover can be viewed on Clover. It can also be viewed in the Woo-Commerce backend.<br \/>\nYou have full control over the orders you receive. You can manually print the receipts or have them auto print. Please<br \/>\nremember your Woo-Commerce and your Clover Inventory are managed independently. This makes it ideal for businesses that<br \/>\nwant to use a different inventory online and a different inventory in-store. If you would like to use your Clover<br \/>\nInventory and not Woo-Commerce, we also have a solution for that- Visit smartonlineorder.com to compare the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Please remember, to get the Api Key, you must install the  Smart Online Order app by going to Clover.com<br \/>\n(from a computer), once app is installed, simply re-open the app a second time to get the Api Key.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/smartonlineorder.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">smartonlineorder.com<\/a> &#8211; You can check the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zaytechapps.com\/privacy-policy\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRIVACY POLICY<\/a><\/p>\n",

This plugin is the ideal solution to accept payment through your Clover in less<br \/>\nthan 10 minutes.<\/p>\n<h4>How it works<\/h4>\n<p>After installing the <strong>WooCommerce Clover Payment Gateway<\/strong>, click on payments in Woocommerce settings, then enter the<br \/>\nApi Key. The Api Key is found by going to Clover.com \u201cMore Tools\u201d then install the \u201cSmart Online Order\u201d app. Once<br \/>\ninstalled, open the app to get the Api Key. Copy the Api Key and paste into the Woo-Commerce payment integration.<br \/>\nSee docs.smartonlineorder.com or search Youtube \u201cSmart Online Order Woo Commerce\u201d for tutorials and help.<\/p>\n<p>Please note: This plugin uses the existing inventory from your Woo-Commerce Store Page. It acts as a payment gateway so<br \/>\nthat payments are processed through your Clover POS. It also Auto Prints the orders that comes from your<br \/>\nWoo Commerce website to your Clover POS.<\/p>\n<p>All Orders processed by the Clover can be viewed on Clover. It can also be viewed in the Woo-Commerce backend.<br \/>\nYou have full control over the orders you receive. You can manually print the receipts or have them auto print. Please<br \/>\nremember your Woo-Commerce and your Clover Inventory are managed independently. This makes it ideal for businesses that<br \/>\nwant to use a different inventory online and a different inventory in-store. If you would like to use your Clover<br \/>\nInventory and not Woo-Commerce, we also have a solution for that- Visit smartonlineorder.com to compare the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Please remember, to get the Api Key, you must install the  Smart Online Order app by going to Clover.com<br \/>\n(from a computer), once app is installed, simply re-open the app a second time to get the Api Key.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"http:\/\/smartonlineorder.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">smartonlineorder.com<\/a> &#8211; You can check the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zaytechapps.com\/privacy-policy\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRIVACY POLICY<\/a><\/p>\n",
