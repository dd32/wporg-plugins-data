That's the case with my site, a blog for a local shooting club with a small number of daily visitors. We use a custom post type to post an update confirming when the range is open (often it's not, due to bad weather) and another when it's closed again, with the second of those updates being scheduled. Because all our members are at the range when it's open we don't get enough visits to trigger that second, scheduled update, so it was being missed a lot of the time.\n\nLong story short: this plugin provides a simple and effective way of scheduling post updates when the standard Wordpress mechanism isn't enough. It's very simple to use, doesn't appear to impact bandwidth or analytics, and the developer is quick to respond when contacted - in my case with a feature request.
