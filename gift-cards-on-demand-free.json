When new products are created, this default % is used to calculate and set the regular price that customers pay. Default markup prices will also automatically adjust whenever cost prices increase or decrease. Default markup prices may be replaced with custom fixed or percentage-based prices at product level.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Automatic Exchange Rates<br \/>\nIf supplier cost prices are USD based, but the default currency of the WooCommerce Store is EUR, all pricing will be converted to EUR using a free API key from Open Exchange Rates.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Limit Stock Availability<br \/>\nThis optional global setting hides actual stock levels from customers and only shows stock up to the maximum limit set by the Store Owner.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Low Wallet Balance Notifications<br \/>\nStore Owners have the option to set a minimum wallet level and receive a notification email when their supplier wallet balance drops below the set amount.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Set Price Mismatch Notifications<br \/>\nThis option allows Store Owners to set a minimum profit percentage. If supplier price changes result in a sale making less profit than the value set, a warning email is sent to the Store Owner.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Bulk Import of Products<br \/>\nSelect up to 100 supplier products at a time to create WooCommerce products. Category selection, custom product names and pricing can all be adjusted on one page before importing. Newly created WooCommerce products are saved to draft status, so that final adjustments can be made before publishing.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Set Percentage Selling Price<br \/>\nThis option sets a custom percentage markup to calculate and set customer prices for a product. The customer pricing will be automatically adjusted whenever supplier prices change so that the Store Owner does not need to adjust prices when supplier prices change.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Set Fixed Foreign Currency Price<br \/>\nThis option automatically adjusts store prices according to a set price in a foreign currency. For example, a store with a EUR default currency might want to sell a USD 100 product for exactly USD 100 irrespective of the exchange rate. This option allows the EUR price to be adjusted so that customers always pay the EUR equivalent of USD 100 for this product. Store Owners can select any currency and set a fixed price for any product. This option relies on the Automatic Exchange Rates feature being enabled.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Hide Or Customize Redemption Instructions<br \/>\nStandard redemption instructions are provided by many suppliers. These default instructions are included in delivery emails to customers. This option allows Store Owners to remove redemption instructions or replace the default instructions with their own.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase At Completed Status<br \/>\nBy default, the plugin will reserve a gift card as soon as the customer has paid, and the order status changes from \u201cPending payment\u201d to \u201cProcessing\u201d. This option allows the purchase of gift cards to be delayed until the order status is changed to \u201cCompleted\u201d.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Send Bulk Order CSV Files<br \/>\nThis option allows bulk orders to be delivered in CSV files. If a Store Owner sets a value of 10 items for example, orders for 10 or more gift cards will be provided in CSV files for the customers convenience.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Restrict Email Delivery<br \/>\nEmail delivery is not always reliable or secure. This option removes gift cards from delivery emails if the customer has an account. Instead, the customer receives a notification email when the gift cards can be downloaded. The customer then needs to login to their account to access\/download their gift cards.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/paythem.net\/gift-card-plugin-woocommerce\/pro\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to PRO here<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Privacy<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin does not share any user information with any external party.
