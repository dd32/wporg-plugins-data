However, it explains well what this plugin does:<\/p>\n<p>Normaly, when a comment gets submitted to a particular post, the author of that post gets a notification about it. But when that comment is held for moderation (which depends on your sites comment settings) then the moderation notification is sent to <em>both<\/em> the post <strong>Author<\/strong> (if he\/she has moderation rights) <em>and<\/em> the sites <strong>Administrative moderator e-mail address<\/strong> as configured under <strong>Settings &gt; General<\/strong> at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>For many blogs or sites where the owner is the only author and his\/her account uses the same e-mail address as the Administrative moderator e-mail address, this will boil down to one message to one address. But when the Site Admin is not the only author, like on <strong>colaboration sites<\/strong> or sites managed by a webmaster or designer where other people like the client usually posts, this might result in flooding the admins mailbox with moderation messages that are not really his\/her concern. The site admin, with enough on his\/her mind already, is bothered with each and every new comment in the moderation queue.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin changes that.<\/p>\n<p>Just install and activate it: All post comment moderation notifications will be sent <strong>only<\/strong> to each respective <strong>Post Author<\/strong>. If, by any chance, the post author has no moderation rights (Contributor level) <em>or<\/em> there is no author e-mail set then the default site e-mail address will still get the notification.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress Multisite compatible, per-site or network activated or as a must-use plugin.<\/p>\n",
