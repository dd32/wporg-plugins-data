(That goes for you or for anyone who logs into your site to add a post or comment.)<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, when a user logs out of your site using a public or shared computer, there won&#8217;t be any domain cookies left behind.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin also gives you back the &#8220;regular user view&#8221; of your site, because after you log out you can browse your site as an anonymous user, without having to manually clear cookies in your browser.

When I logout, the favorite buttons should be unpressed and I shouldn't be able to see favorite lists, but I was still seeing them and buttons still remained pressed. I cleared cache, disabled all plugins and reactivated one by one, changed theme, tried different browser, different computer, etc, etc, but could solve it. Then I found out if I manually remove cookies after logout, it solves the problem. But I cannot ask users to remove cookies after logging out. So I was wishing there would be a plugin to clear cookies after users logout. And there it is! This plugin solved all issues at once. Thanks so much!! <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/khalka\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9f384d178c04aad8395aabbb99236d39?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/9f384d178c04aad8395aabbb99236d39?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/khalka\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">khalka<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">May 15, 2018<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">It's, work!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
