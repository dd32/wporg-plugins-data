Have a PDF, Word, or printed form? <a href=\"https:\/\/app.hipaatizer.com\/upload-sign-up\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Submit it to HIPAAtizer<\/a>, and it will be converted into a HIPAA-Compliant online form with free printable HIPAA forms matching the original design.<\/p>\n<p>Or, if you want to create your own forms, HIPAAtizer\u2019s Drag &amp; Drop HIPAA form builder gives you all the tools you need to create professional-looking HIPAA-Compliant forms.  In addition, HIPAAtizer allows you to convert Contact Form 7 forms, customize fields, and use a style grabber to match your existing CSS styles.<\/p>\n<p>Add forms to your website using the Gutenberg component, shortcode or embedded code.<\/p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/hipaa-compliance-pricing\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing page<\/a> for details on our packages for organizations who need a full range of HIPAA-Compliant form and document solutions.<\/p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer meets and exceeds all HIPAA requirements, including secure submission hosting, data collection, encrypted emails and Protected Health Information (PHI) access logging.<\/p>\n<p>Generate printable templates in MS Word or PDF, keeping the original design, receive submissions via email and webhooks, and push submissions to other systems using webhooks or download them in CSV or PDF formats. Pull form submissions data to third party systems using REST API.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always free for developers!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Use our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/hipaa-form-solutions\/developers\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sandbox environment<\/a> to explore our features and capabilities and build forms for your clients.<\/p>\n<p>Explore our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/partnership-program\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">partnership program<\/a> to discover how HIPAAtizer rewards our partners.<\/p>\n<p>With HIPAAtizer, maintaining HIPAA compliance for your websites is effortless and efficient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>HIPAAtizer&#8217;s latest features:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional logic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>HIPAAtizer enables the creation of flexible, user-friendly and HIPAA-Compliant forms! To minimize clutter on forms or customize them for respondents, HIPAAtizer allows certain questions to be displayed based on the responses to a previous question (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/docs\/using-and-managing-conditional-logic\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">conditional logic<\/a> display feature).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save &amp; Continue Later<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Save &amp; Continue Later functionality is possible with HIPAAtizer forms. The client can click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/docs\/save-and-continue-later-instruction\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Save &amp; Continue Later<\/a> to save their progress. The system will ask them for an email address, it will send a confirmation code, and a link to continue the form when they are ready to do so.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combining Multiple Forms in One Workflow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With HIPAAtizer, you can create form workflows to link multiple forms together. Linked forms can be filled in a defined order in one or multiple sessions using the unique next-step link. Covered Entities can send next-step links to their customers to continue <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/docs\/hipaatizer-workflows\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">workflows<\/a>. This eliminates missed forms and the need to send multiple PDFs or multiple links.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>HIPAAsign<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>HIPAAtizer also provides HIPAA-Compliant document signing (HIPAAsign) functionality. With HIPAAsign, you can create forms that include multiple participants. For example, signing a contract with a client. First, you add specific items, such as prices and\/or custom terms and conditions, then you forward the contract to your client to fill-out and sign. HIPAAsign also allows you to specify the number of participants in the signing workflow, their order, and who needs to enter the data into each form field. It is also possible to hide certain form elements from other participants.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/b2MCt-dL7Ew?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p><strong>How It Works:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer enables HIPAA Compliance by adding secure Protected Health Information (PHI) forms to your website.

Install the WordPress plugin and create a free HIPAAtizer developer account.<br \/>\n2.  Build and customize forms using practice-specific templates or create your own with the built-in drag &amp; drop form builder. Alternatively, convert existing Contact Form 7 forms. Need help? <a href=\"https:\/\/app.hipaatizer.com\/upload-sign-up\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Submit Word or PDF files<\/a> and HIPAAtizer will convert them for you.<br \/>\n3.

HIPAA-regulated clients can receive form submissions via email with encrypted and password-protected PDF files, or by using the HIPAA-Compliant RESTful API.<br \/>\n5.  Users can access the dashboard to view audit logs and form submissions, continually update form fields, adjust styles, and more.<\/p>\n<h3>Installation Instructions<\/h3>\n<h4>Automatic installation<\/h4>\n<p>Log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click \u201cAdd New&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;HIPAAtizer,\u201d then click \u201cSearch Plugins.\u201d Once you\u2019ve found it, you can install it by clicking \u201cInstall Now,\u201d and WordPress will take it from there.<\/p>\n<h4>Manual installation<\/h4>\n<p>The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/article\/managing-plugins\/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;hipaatizer&#8217; folder to the &#8216;\/wp-content\/plugins\/&#8217; directory<\/li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Additional Resources<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/hipaatizer.com\/free-developer-account#how-it-works\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Docs<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/hipaa-compliance-resources\/faq\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20hipaatizer%3F'>\nWhat is HIPAAtizer?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer is a WordPress plugin for a HIPAA-Compliant form builder and HIPAA-Compliant document sharing solution. Download the plugin and create a Free Sandbox Account to help your clients implement fully HIPAA-Compliant forms on their websites. You and your clients have the choice of using one of our templates or you can create customized forms using our drag &amp; drop functionality, which allows maximum customization and flexibility. You can use the WordPress HIPAA-Compliant Plugin with Gutenberg Component, HIPAAtizer dashboard, Developer Account and Contact Form 7 importer, all for free. You can add your HIPAA-Compliant form to any website with just one line of embedded code.

In addition, HIPAAtizer provides HIPAA forms for WordPress with fully customizable, encrypted, printable PDF forms.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20phi%3F'>\nWhat is PHI?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAA is an act that regulates how Protected Health Information (PHI) is secured. PHI includes all individually identifiable health information, including demographic data, medical histories, test results, insurance information, and other information used to identify a patient or provide healthcare services or health care coverage. \u201cProtected\u201d means the information is protected under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20hipaa-compliant%20online%20form%3F'>\nWhat is a HIPAA-Compliant online form?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For online forms to be fully HIPAA Compliant, all the PHI data should be encrypted at rest and in transit. To ensure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/hipaa-compliance-resources\/hipaa-compliance\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HIPAA Compliance<\/a>, HIPAAtizer uses FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption. In addition to data encryption, HIPAA requires that the PHI data be securely backed-up and that deletions are permanent.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20hipaatizer%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does HIPAAtizer cost?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin and cloud sandbox account are free for developers. Covered Entities sign a Business Associate Agreement and choose an appropriate plan. Plans start from $29 a month with annual billing, depending on the size of the practice or organization. Moreover, custom packages are available for developers, marketing agencies and IT service providers  who manage multiple websites, giving them a range of advanced features and functions, all at a reasonable price. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/contact-us\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ask us<\/a> about our discounts for multiple accounts.

HIPAAtizer\u2019s responsibilities are clearly set out in our Business Associate Agreement that we sign with all Covered Entities.  HIPAAtizer, as a Business Associate, is subject to the same stringent privacy and security regulations as a Covered Entity.  In addition, emails, forms and other documents originating in HIPAAtizer use FIPS 140-2 compliant protocols to encrypt messages for full end-to-end encryption, and all communication is secured using SSL (TLS 1.2).<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='will%20a%20user%20be%20notified%20when%20someone%20fills%20out%20an%20online%20form%3F'>\nWill a user be notified when someone fills out an online form?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, when the Covered Entity sets up its team members in HIPAAtizer, it chooses which of its users will receive a notification every time a form is submitted. Only internally approved team members will have the necessary access to open the forms to view the PHI. PHI can be included in these notifications as the PDF files containing the PHI are fully encrypted.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20add%20a%20hipaa-compliant%20form%20to%20a%20website%3F'>\nHow to add a HIPAA-Compliant form to a website?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install the plugin. You will see HIPAAtizer in the WordPress menu on the left. Connect your website to an existing HIPAAtizer account or create a free developer account. You can choose a form template, customize it or create your own.  After you&#8217;re happy with the form, you can publish it.  To fully activate the form, your client, the Covered Entity, should accept the HIPAAtizer Terms of Use and agree to the Business Associate Agreement.  Once this is done, the form is now fully HIPAA-Compliant and ready to use!<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20forms%20can%20i%20add%3F'>\nHow many forms can I add?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are a developer, you can create as many forms as you want for free. Also, you can create forms for different Covered Entities and keep them in your folders.  For a Covered Entity, the price for our products starts from $29\/month. Our custom packages give the Covered Entity an unlimited number of active forms.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

Our requirements are complex. For every program we do, we have three assessments that have to be linked together consecutively. They have multiple scales per assessment with complex scoring by scale, by assessment, and number of questions answered. They have to be timed. In addition, one of the assessments requires forced choice ranking, where participants have to choose an equal number of answers from two columns before they can submit. I looked at over 15 assessment\/forms plugins in WordPress. They could meet basic needs, but no one could handle the complex ones. And then I discovered the HIPAAtizer WordPress plugin. HIPAAtizer proved to be exactly what I was looking for! Their team looked at our requirements and was able to build the functionality we required within their platform. They even loaded and configured the assessments. I am very impressed and would recommend the HIPAAtizer platform and team. It is easy to use, coded well, and has great support. The fact that I know the data is secure because of their HIPAA certification is an added bonus. For anyone looking to automate GAD-7, AUDIT, PHQ-9, PHQ-15, ORT assessments, HIPAAtizer will definitely work for you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Super Easy HIPAA Forms<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jonroot\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c5ba421a5e276059ed7733156b94d69f?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/c5ba421a5e276059ed7733156b94d69f?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jonroot\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jonroot<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">July 20, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">The full service feature is the way to go.

To minimize clutter on forms or customize them for respondents, HIPAAtizer allows certain questions to be displayed based on the responses to a previous question (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hipaatizer.com\/docs\/using-and-managing-conditional-logic\/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">conditional logic<\/a> display feature).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save &amp; Continue Later<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Save &amp; Continue Later functionality is possible with HIPAAtizer forms.

With HIPAAsign, you can create forms that include multiple participants. For example, signing a contract with a client. First, you add specific items, such as prices and\/or custom terms and conditions, then you forward the contract to your client to fill-out and sign. HIPAAsign also allows you to specify the number of participants in the signing workflow, their order, and who needs to enter the data into each form field. It is also possible to hide certain form elements from other participants.<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/b2MCt-dL7Ew?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n<p><strong>How It Works:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer enables HIPAA Compliance by adding secure Protected Health Information (PHI) forms to your website.
