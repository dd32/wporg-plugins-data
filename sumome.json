Extremely limited functions for the cost, but it did the job.\nNot anymore. Now it is essentially an overpriced paperweight on our site. We grew, hired a webmaster team who updated all of our very old stuff, and guess what? Sumo stopped working. Removing and replacing the app only made things worse. Repeated messages to their tech support ignored the information we gave them. Instead they came back with canned solutions that did not work (code to directly install on the site). Refusing to admit the problem is on their end, they claimed the problems must have something to do with a plugin on ours, but the pros we hired streamlined our site so we have fewer plugins than before. \n\nWhen we asked them to think a little harder, they offered no other solutions and just wanted full control of our website. Not on your life. Their user interface doesn't even work fully on Firefox. We had to use Safari. If they can't make a functional UI across browsers, we're certainly not going to let them toy around with our site. When we told them this relationship wouldn't work anymore, they refused to prorate us the remainder of our subscription, citing a previous discount. Just for clarity, even with that discount, the service was grossly overpriced. We were trying to be nice and support another small business during COVID when we agreed to it. I guess that turned around and bit us.\nTo sum up: Too expensive for limited functionality, even with our heavy discount. Doesn't work anymore now that we've updated and modernized our site. Terrible customer service.\n\nDo not use this app.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Just Bad<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/miheui\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f2579760517e6f53e1031afa9d04caf6?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/f2579760517e6f53e1031afa9d04caf6?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/miheui\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">miheui<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">October 3, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">First, this plugin is a hog. My site speed significantly decreased. Also, the plugin takes you to Sumo website, where it is sooooooo slow. I couldn't get anything done because it took so long to do. Second, it says \"free,\" but it really is not. They give you virtually nothing for \"free,\" and their pricing is so outrageous for the paid version. They could at least give you an intermediary price.  (They also do NOT have my newsletter subscription service -- Revue -- which means an automatic dump.)  I'm sick and tired of these scam plugin creators.  I understand making a business, but this is just a scam.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">They hacking your site!!You will not be able to uninstall popup from your site!<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"1 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"1\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jebacsumome\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/adb4c9f381838d6039ca09213acfbba7?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/adb4c9f381838d6039ca09213acfbba7?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/jebacsumome\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jebacsumome<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 31, 2021<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I was using Sumome plugin for years but from last month I can not login to sumo and remove the popup from my site.

The support do not respond for your requests. I had to register to WordPress to give the this opinion  (I think that opinions like my will be much more if the sending opinions for plugins in WordPress will be much easier to do). I can remove this opinion if you respond me how to remove the summon popup from my site. I can not connect the new accounting some to my site because I have information that I wrote wrong login or password even if it is correct or show information that I have not authorized e-mail but for this e-mail I did not get any e-mail from sumo.

But the developers at SUMO DO NOT care about user experience.  They show no consideration for efficiency, and have built an app that contains settings BUT YOU HAVE NO WAY OF ACCESSING THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThey now have this stupid dashboard that all it does it take you to sumo.com and show you visitor stats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can not configure any part of this app any longer!!! Because apparently the developers who don't even provide a dashboard to settings now force you to use whatever settings, social media channels and subscription boxes they see fit!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI couldn't be more done with this stupid plugin if you paid me.  I can't uninstall this fast enough.  I have been using the free version for over 5 years and I promise you by end of business today I will be paying for whatever their competition is. I may even just go purchase convert kit and grow.  TWO SUBSCRIPTION PLUGINS!!!! \n\nImagine what that says right there.  I am willing to go give 2 different developers I have no experience with my money over 1 developer I have multiple years experience with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUNBELIEVABLE SUMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!  CANT EVEN COMPREHEND YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!!!!!!!!!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Heavy code adds 440 kb to page<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"2 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"2\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mattgoddard\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a6fa5589e1c3de6a2ec35165b6d4138e?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/a6fa5589e1c3de6a2ec35165b6d4138e?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mattgoddard\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">mattgoddard<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">August 26, 2020<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">After install and activation (no configuration completed) the app had added just short of 440kb to my homepage and 21 external requests.
