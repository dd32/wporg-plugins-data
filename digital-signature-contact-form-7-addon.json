Your estranged client is claiming that they should not have to pay their invoice, even though you did all the work, and there is a document with their name on it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.  There\u2019s nothing I can do.  This contract is not valid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Something like this can <strong>ruin your business<\/strong>, even though you have done absolutely nothing wrong.<\/p>\n<p>The E-Signing industry has a long set of strict rules and regulations that all documents must follow.  That goes for all invoices, contracts, and agreements that your business may use.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of guessing whether or not your documents are valid, take the steps to guarantee that they are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ApproveMe WP E-Signature Plugin for Contact Form 7 turns your website into a court recognized legal document signing application.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that Contact Form 7 is a fantastic plugin.  It\u2019s able to automate tasks on your site and make gathering user data quite simple.  However, it\u2019s important to note that signing legally binding contracts is NOT what they specialize in.  That\u2019s where we step in.<\/p>\n<p>The WP E-Signature Plugin for Contact Form 7 ensures that every single contract, form or invoice submitted through Contact Form 7 is 100% UETA\/ESIGN compliant.<\/p>\n<p>No more questioning whether or not your forms are legal.  Plus, you\u2019ll never need to pay another third-party signing service ever again.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has put a lot of time into building a system that follows all of the rules and regulations of the e-signing industry, not just in the United States, but all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>You have the right to control your user experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=contact-form-7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click Here to Try a Contact Form 7 Signature Demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Most Signature Plugins &amp; Add-Ons<\/strong> only record the details of signatures and send them to your FTP server as image files.<\/p>\n<p>These image files (of your client\u2019s legal signature) are made EASILY accessible to FTP intruders.  Other E-sign plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA\/ESIGN compliant) because <strong>they fail to address most of the industry\u2019s laws and regulations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any dispute over your contracts would not be in your favor.  If you or a client ever fell victim to fraud or identity theft, you would not have much to stand on.  Why risk it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the Powerful Features of ApproveMe\u2019s E-Sign Plugin for Contact Form 7:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>UETA\/ESIGN Compliance<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We keep our plugin 100% compliant with the most current e-signing laws.  Rest easy knowing that any form or document signed with this plugin will stand up in court.<\/p>\n<p><em>Unique Signer Downloads<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Secure your PDF downloads.  Only when the sender is logged in and when the signer uses their unique download invitation can a contract be downloaded.<\/p>\n<p><em>Encrypted Data Storage<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unlike other plugins, we never store data on easily accessible FTP servers.  We encrypt and store data in different strategic locations in your database.  Everything is fully secure.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, if a hacker were to even attempt to unencrpyt you data, the entire file would destroy itself.  We invested heavily into the security of this plugin so that your documents will be completely safe.<\/p>\n<p><em>Instant Trigger Redirects<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Redirect your signers to their contracts immediately after filling out a form.  This will help move your clients down the funnel without forgetting any steps or getting confused by directions.  It will be much easier to get your contracts signed.<\/p>\n<p><em>Responsive Design<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Get your contracts signed from anywhere.  Our plugin works with all desktop and mobile browsers for both Android and iOS devices including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dynamic Form Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Take sections on info from your forms and dynamically insert them into your contracts.  Now all of your contracts will be customized for your clients.<\/p>\n<p><em>Signing Reminder Emails<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Having trouble getting your client\u2019s signature?  Set up automatic reminder emails to make sure they sign.  You choose the trigger date and frequency.  The plugin does the rest.<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are no limits to how many contracts you can create.  Everyone on your team can have access to the plugin.  We simply don\u2019t believe in limits, or hidden fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Secure your contracts and rest easy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=contact-form-7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here for a demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Need Customer Support?<\/h3>\n<p>To prevent support tickets from getting lost in the abyss, we created a full support resource on our website.

WP E-Signature is triggered once a Contact Form is submitted.

Don\u2019t worry \u2014 your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.  It will show the customer\u2019s provided info anywhere the shortcode is found.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 6:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Select your document preferences and save settings<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve inserted all the required contract text and linked your WP form fields to your Stand Alone Document, it\u2019s time to choose your document settings.<\/p>\n<p>Important note: Before you can post your contract form, you must link your Stand Alone Document to the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the &#8220;Display on this page&#8221; drop down option list found under the &#8220;Document Options&#8221; area.<\/p>\n<p>We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a Contact Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted Contact Form.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 7:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Almost there\u2026 (halfway done)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve published your Stand Alone Document, you\u2019re halfway done.

Your estranged client is claiming that they should not have to pay their invoice, even though you did all the work, and there is a document with their name on it.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.  There\u2019s nothing I can do.  This contract is not valid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Something like this can <strong>ruin your business<\/strong>, even though you have done absolutely nothing wrong.<\/p>\n<p>The E-Signing industry has a long set of strict rules and regulations that all documents must follow.  That goes for all invoices, contracts, and agreements that your business may use.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of guessing whether or not your documents are valid, take the steps to guarantee that they are.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The ApproveMe WP E-Signature Plugin for Contact Form 7 turns your website into a court recognized legal document signing application.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that Contact Form 7 is a fantastic plugin.  It\u2019s able to automate tasks on your site and make gathering user data quite simple.  However, it\u2019s important to note that signing legally binding contracts is NOT what they specialize in.  That\u2019s where we step in.<\/p>\n<p>The WP E-Signature Plugin for Contact Form 7 ensures that every single contract, form or invoice submitted through Contact Form 7 is 100% UETA\/ESIGN compliant.<\/p>\n<p>No more questioning whether or not your forms are legal.  Plus, you\u2019ll never need to pay another third-party signing service ever again.<\/p>\n<p>Our team has put a lot of time into building a system that follows all of the rules and regulations of the e-signing industry, not just in the United States, but all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>You have the right to control your user experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=contact-form-7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click Here to Try a Contact Form 7 Signature Demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Most Signature Plugins &amp; Add-Ons<\/strong> only record the details of signatures and send them to your FTP server as image files.<\/p>\n<p>These image files (of your client\u2019s legal signature) are made EASILY accessible to FTP intruders.  Other E-sign plugins are not legally binding (and certainly not UETA\/ESIGN compliant) because <strong>they fail to address most of the industry\u2019s laws and regulations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any dispute over your contracts would not be in your favor.  If you or a client ever fell victim to fraud or identity theft, you would not have much to stand on.  Why risk it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Some of the Powerful Features of ApproveMe\u2019s E-Sign Plugin for Contact Form 7:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>UETA\/ESIGN Compliance<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We keep our plugin 100% compliant with the most current e-signing laws.  Rest easy knowing that any form or document signed with this plugin will stand up in court.<\/p>\n<p><em>Unique Signer Downloads<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Secure your PDF downloads.  Only when the sender is logged in and when the signer uses their unique download invitation can a contract be downloaded.<\/p>\n<p><em>Encrypted Data Storage<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unlike other plugins, we never store data on easily accessible FTP servers.  We encrypt and store data in different strategic locations in your database.  Everything is fully secure.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, if a hacker were to even attempt to unencrpyt you data, the entire file would destroy itself.  We invested heavily into the security of this plugin so that your documents will be completely safe.<\/p>\n<p><em>Instant Trigger Redirects<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Redirect your signers to their contracts immediately after filling out a form.  This will help move your clients down the funnel without forgetting any steps or getting confused by directions.  It will be much easier to get your contracts signed.<\/p>\n<p><em>Responsive Design<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Get your contracts signed from anywhere.  Our plugin works with all desktop and mobile browsers for both Android and iOS devices including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.<\/p>\n<p><em>Dynamic Form Fields<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Take sections on info from your forms and dynamically insert them into your contracts.  Now all of your contracts will be customized for your clients.<\/p>\n<p><em>Signing Reminder Emails<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Having trouble getting your client\u2019s signature?  Set up automatic reminder emails to make sure they sign.  You choose the trigger date and frequency.  The plugin does the rest.<\/p>\n<p><em>Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There are no limits to how many contracts you can create.  Everyone on your team can have access to the plugin.  We simply don\u2019t believe in limits, or hidden fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Secure your contracts and rest easy. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secure.approveme.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=contact-form-7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here for a demo<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>Need Customer Support?<\/h3>\n<p>To prevent support tickets from getting lost in the abyss, we created a full support resource on our website.
