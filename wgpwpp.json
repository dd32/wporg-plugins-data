The company invests in technology, innovation and research to offer quality services for affordable prices to the widest possible customer base. WEDOS maintains two privately-owned datacenters and is about to build a third one.<br \/>\nThe first datacenter, WEDOS DC 1 &#8220;Bunkr&#8221;, was founded in 2010 and modernized between 2018 and 2020. The second datacenter, WEDOS DC 2 &#8220;Podksal\u00ed&#8221;, is a unique project designed to cool servers using oil and water. The third datacenter, WEDOS DC 3 &#8220;Krav\u00edn&#8221; is under development and meant to house more servers and storage.

Its main purpose is to load web pages faster, decrease server loads and protect against various online threats, such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized access. Install the plugin in your WordPress administration and change DNS servers according to instructions, so it can effectively monitor and filter website traffic.<br \/>\nThe plugin works on the anycast proxy principle, which directs traffic through its optimized and secure servers. These servers process and optimize content before it reaches users. The plugin also utilizes intelligent caching, compression and minification of files to further speed up rendering times and reduce server load. It also features a firewall, bot detection, DDoS protection and other tools to maintain a high level of security for your website and users.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20exactly%20am%20i%20paying%20for%3F'>\nWhat exactly am I paying for?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>For a small fee, you can use our services, which handle a lot of the hardest chores associated with running a website. This includes filtering unwanted traffic, detecting and blocking attacks, distributing content using a global miniCDN (Content Delivery Network), and caching content to optimize your web\\&#8217;s overall performance worldwide.<br \/>\nOur services cost a fraction of the price offered by our competition. You gain access to cutting-edge technology and know-how without the need to invest large sums of money. We offer an effective and affordable solution to your website performance and security needs.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20register%3F'>\nDo I need to register?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, registration is necessary. It grants you access to our administration panel, where you can manage WEDOS Global and other services offered by our global infrastructure. After registering, we analyze your website to find out how to optimize its protection plan. Based ot this analysis, we deploy security measures, such as a web firewall, bot blocking, or access control. Your personal information is stored in accordance with GDPR, which regulates privacy, integrity and accessibility of personal information, as well as accessing, updating and deleting this data.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20an%20official%20website%3F'>\nDo you have an official website?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the project website is wedos.global<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20try%20the%20service%20first%3F'>\nCan I try the service first?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can test the service through a free trial to learn about its functions and decide whether it\\&#8217;s the right solution for you.<br \/>\nWe also offer a version for private use, which is also free. It is designed for individuals who want to protect their websites or projects without committing to the full-scale solution.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20collect%20personal%20information%3F'>\nDo you collect personal information?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we do collect some personal data, all in accordance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Our company keeps user privacy front-and-center, and handles personal information with the highest degree of responsibility. All your data is processed in a transparent and secure manner in accordance with law. We strive to collect the least amount of data possible to provide and improve our services.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20deactivate%20or%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat happens if I deactivate or uninstall the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Even after you unistall or deactivate the plugin, your WEDOS Global service will remain active. This means that even if you can no longer see the plugin in your WordPress administration, your domain is still protected. Deactivating or uninstalling the plugin therefore has no effect on an already protected domain. If you want to use the plugin features, you will need to reactivate or reinstall it. To completely cancel the WEDOS Global service and stop protecting your domain, you have to deactivate this protection via the administration panel at client.wedos.global.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",
