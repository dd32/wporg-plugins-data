We had been using other booking plugins, none of which came close to the functionality of Amelia. There is a free version to try out many of the features - we had this installed for just a few days before being convinced the full version was the way to go. Pricing structure is great so you don't need to pay for the bits you don't need -and lifetime licenses make this a very affordable option. The support available is excellent -very knowledgeable and responsive teams who know the answers to the most obscure questions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Perfect Solution<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pheck\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/46ff63af748907554390b7c4abba61e1?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/46ff63af748907554390b7c4abba61e1?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/pheck\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">pheck<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 19, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">I use Amelia since some times and it works perfectly.
