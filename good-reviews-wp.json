Just open your WordPress admin, click on Reviews and then Add New. There, on one screen, you&#8217;ll be able to add in all the info for your review, including the reviewer, the rating, the featured image, the details and more!<\/p>\n<p>Follow these steps for each restaurant review you have and, in no time, you&#8217;ll be ready to show all the great feedback you&#8217;ve received from your restaurant customers on your site, complete with all the appropriate restaurant structured data. There are three ways to display your reviews:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gutenberg block<\/strong>: Search for the &#8220;Display Reviews&#8221; block and add it to any page, to instantly display your reviews. The block includes several parameters to refine which reviews will show, such as review ID and category slug.<\/li>\n<li><strong>An easy-to-use restaurant review shortcode<\/strong>: Add the [good-reviews] shortcode to any page or post to instantly display your reviews. It comes with a host of attributes to narrow down your display to a specific review, category, etc. The full list can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/doc.fivestarplugins.com\/plugins\/good-reviews-wp\/user\/faq#shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The restaurant review widget<\/strong>: You can use the widget to add your reviews to any sidebar area, by going to Appearance &gt; Widgets.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Individual restaurant review page<\/strong>: Each review also automatically gets its own individual webpage, so you can link directly to the review or easily add it as a menu item on your site.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The included restaurant review structured data gets automatically added to each review. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you add the review via block, shortcode or widget, the appropriate restaurant schema will be included in the code.<\/p>\n<h4>Additional Restaurant Review Features<\/h4>\n<p>This restaurant rating and review plugin comes with additional features that allow you to offer a great experience on your site.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration with the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/restaurant-reservations\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Five Star Restaurant Reservations<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/food-and-drink-menu\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Five Star Restaurant Menu<\/a> plugins to automatically add reviews to your booking form and menu pages.<\/li>\n<li>Add a submit review form for specific menu items in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/food-and-drink-menu\/\" rel=\"ugc\">Five Star Restaurant Menu<\/a> plugin.<\/li>\n<li>Add a link to the review or the reviewer&#8217;s organization to increase credibility.<\/li>\n<li>Assign reviews to categories for easy management and targeted display.<\/li>\n<li>Show a single review, all reviews or a category of reviews.<\/li>\n<li>List reviews or cycle through them with a fader.<\/li>\n<li>Re-order reviews.<\/li>\n<li>Add a custom link to the review.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The restaurant ratings and reviews are added in as a custom post type.
