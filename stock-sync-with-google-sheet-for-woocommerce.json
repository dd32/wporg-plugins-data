The good news? You get <em>outstanding<\/em> information via text <em>and<\/em> video to help you set up things correctly \u2014 there is no way anything will go wrong, the authors of this plugin have it covered, and they set you up with the bare minimum of fuss so that you can start experimenting.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And it will work straight out of the box indeed, as others have described. Granted, it's not <em>just<\/em> point &amp; click, and depending on the complexity of your own setup (in my case, Google Sheets is just 'middleware' to allow my customer's internal database to keep in sync with WooCommerce \u2014 so it meant some extra coding on my side), it may take you an afternoon \u2014 or just five minutes. YMMV!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sadly, however, the free\/demo version has extremely limited functionality: just 20 products, and there is no real 'sync' \u2014 rather, WooCommerce will just export the products you've got to Google Sheets, using a very strictly limited number of columns (the barest of bare minimums). This is hardly enough to get a proof of concept \u2014 you'd need the full version for that.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And you will have to deal with all sorts of errors along the way, which do <em>not<\/em> come from the plugin itself, but rather from the way the several layers of software must communicate to reach across the wide gap between WordPress + WooCommerce and whatever database backend you're integrating with via Google Sheets. For instance, the following error (coming from Google AppScripts) left me baffled: <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>SyntaxError: Unexpected token '&lt;', \"&lt;!DOCTYPE \"\u2026 is not valid JSON<br \/>at ssgsw_sync_data(Integration with WooCommerce.gs:341:18)<br \/>at ssgsw_sync_all(Integration with WooCommerce.gs:324:2)<\/code><\/pre>\n<!-- \/wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It took me a while to understand that this is related to my several layers in front of WP\/WooCommerce. At some point, the plugin will give an error because I did have indeed more than 20 products. This error hits the <code>nginx<\/code> webserver, which gets confused (because it's a JSON error, not an application error), and emits the code as part of a regular web page, with the JSON embedded in it. This, in turn, is shielded by the protection layer above it: Cloudflare, which will add their own headers and embed some cookies and so forth. When the error finally hits the Google AppScript engine, it has been gone through so many transformations that the AppScript (note: it's automatically generated by the plugin itself) cannot figure out what kind of reply it got. To deal with this particular environment, therefore, I would need to add some more wrapper code along the way \u2014 letting a JSON error to go through the many layers unscathed \u2014 or, optionally, have the AppScript add a few more checks before reading whatever it received, and not automatically assume that it'll get something <em>precisely<\/em> formatted as expected...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Granted, my environment <em>may<\/em> be a bit odd here and there, and rather not exactly what <em>most<\/em> people have installed. But you should take into account that, except for the simplest of online shops, 'real' shops or online marketplaces will have several levels of complexity, and whether this plugin will do its magic or not will depend on a lot of factors... for which you might not be able to get a workaround. At least not with the demo\/free version \u2014 it's simply too limited for that.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, without being able to show my customer a proof of concept using this plugin, they hardly will be impressed, or give the go-ahead to use this particular solution.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a few alternatives around \u2014 most with some sort of free or demo or trial versions \u2014 and, in my case, I had no choice but to remove the plugin and try with something different.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which is a pity, really; as said, the plugin is not only very polished and well-coded, it includes the fantastic documentation (with tutorial videos!), which turns a difficult task into a reasonably easy way to set things up.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Works very good<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"4 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"4\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-empty\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hungryjos\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1badd31e86d70d60f5bb1623535d4d25?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/1badd31e86d70d60f5bb1623535d4d25?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/hungryjos\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">HungryJos<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">June 5, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">Tried it out and works really good!\nWe're using WPML in multilingual shop, and our products are translated. This means all products show up in the table multiple times. It would be great if this would work with the SKU's so we only need to change this in the sheet once. Although it really syncs very fast between all languages (stocks update in Woocommerce for all translations through the sku's)\nA negative comment on here was that it had nothinng to do with stock keeping, but I believe that was incorrect: it does work with stock numbers. On initial you do get In Stock or Out of stock, but when you change the numbers in your sheet this updates on Woocommerce as well. haven't tested this thoroughly bjt this looks very promising. Would be great to hear if there is a way to sync the same Google sheet with multiple shops that would tick all the boxes for my use case.\nI'm giving it 4 stars because there's product names instead of SKU's in the columns of the sheet. SKU's would be a more logic to me. <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great plugin, easy to use<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rsurfer\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7097bc85f178b5a95695757a8d83a527?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7097bc85f178b5a95695757a8d83a527?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/rsurfer\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">rsurfer<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">April 10, 2022<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\">I've been looking for something like this for a while.
