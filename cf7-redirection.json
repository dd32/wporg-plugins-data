This plugin is the only redirect plugin for Contact Form 7 that has been updated to use <a href=\"https:\/\/contactform7.com\/dom-events\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DOM events<\/a> to perform redirect, as  developer Takayuki Miyoshi recommends.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n",

I almost died when I realized I might have to redo everything. This plugin came to the rescue and worked perfectly! New abilities already and hoping the development continues to make this an extremely welcome addition to the CF7 add-on community. THANK YOU!<\/div>\n<\/div>\n"
