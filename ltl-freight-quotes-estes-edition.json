To ensure the most accurate quote possible, make sure that every product has a weight, dimensions and a freight classification recorded.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20identify%20a%20freight%20classification%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I forget to identify a freight classification for a product?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the absence of a freight class, the plugin will determine the freight classification using the density calculation method. To do so the products weight and dimensions must be recorded. This is accurate in most cases, however identifying the proper freight class will be the most reliable method for ensuring accurate rate estimates.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20the%20invoice%20i%20received%20from%20estes%20freight%20more%20than%20what%20was%20quoted%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy was the invoice I received from Estes Freight more than what was quoted by the plugin?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions, freight class) is different, or additional services (such as residential<br \/>\ndelivery, lift gate, delivery by appointment and others) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping<br \/>\nsettings on the products included in the shipment. Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packaging<br \/>\nmaterials, such as a pallet, is included by the carrier in the billable weight for the shipment.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20what%20freight%20classification%20to%20use%20for%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow do I find out what freight classification to use for my products?\n<\/h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact your local Estes Freight office for assistance.
