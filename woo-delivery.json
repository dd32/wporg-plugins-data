It is a useful plugin for my online business. But their support is really bad. I had a few issues and wrote in to the support team a few times. Their replies and and supports are unhelpful and seems to be reluctant to provide any solution. I ended up living with all the issues. I am too busy with my business to keep following with their lazy reply. There was once they just tell me that there is nothing they can do and I have to just live with the problem of their plugin. I just wrote another request for support earlier because I had problems with their delivery report. The reply was so flippant and unhelpful. I do not know what they meant. It has been like this since I subscribed to their pro version. I saw good reviews about their support. I am not sure are they genuine reviews or they give better support to those who are using free versions. I am giving two stars because their plugin is useful, but their technical support is very bad. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n\t<div class=\"review-head\">\n\t\t<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great plugin, great support<\/h4>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"star-rating\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"><\/span><\/div>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"reviewer\">\n\t\t\t\tBy <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spiffydrip\/\"><img alt='' src='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4040ea55daf05011ae24e1d14a1ec336?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g' srcset='https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/4040ea55daf05011ae24e1d14a1ec336?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-16 photo' height='16' width='16' loading='lazy' decoding='async'\/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/spiffydrip\/\" class=\"reviewer-name\">spiffydrip<\/a> on <span class=\"review-date\">January 15, 2024<\/span>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"review-body\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p class=\"\">Purchased this for my online cupcake store that has deliveries and pickups (collection).
