Additionally, agents can create, delete, close, and perform any other action given to them by the admin.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Agent Auto Assign &#8211; Ticket auto-assignment is a simple but critical process in the handling and closing of help desk tickets. When auto-assign is enabled, the ticket is assigned to an appropriate agent based on the rules.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi Forms &#8211; By using this multi-form functionality, admins, agents, and users, as well as visitors with the necessary permissions, can create different ticket forms to accommodate various request types based on user roles.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Paid Support &#8211; For using your support services, charge users. Create subscriptions based on duration, such as a monthly membership, or the number of tickets, like 10 tickets per month, or charge for each ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Time Tracking &#8211; Track the time spent on tickets in the most precise manner while also providing client and agent-level reporting. Keep a manual record of the time invested in each ticket response.  When the ticket is open in the agent&#8217;s browser track the time with a single click, and stop the time tracking with one click once the agent has finished with the ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>WooCommerce &#8211; If you have a WooCommerce store, then integrate Majestic Support with it to offer a smooth support solution. This is a must-have bridge between your WooCommerce store and Majestic Support. This means that consumers can submit tickets to report a specific order or to express any issues they may be having with the website.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Email Piping &#8211; From the comfort of an email account, create tickets or reply to them. For example, you could offer your clients a special email address like support@yourdomain.com. The emails received in this email will be converted to tickets. The add-on also contains built-in options to control how to manage responses to tickets that have been closed, unrecognized email addresses, and much more.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Merge Tickets &#8211; Hundreds of tickets have been submitted for assistance, some of which may be on the same topic and have similar questions. To provide support for each ticket with the same topic would be a waste of time. With this add-on, you can merge any of the two tickets or more with the same topic and query and provide support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket Overdue &#8211; An &#8220;overdue ticket&#8221; is one that has not been resolved or has not been responded to in a timely manner. By adding this add-on, you can set auto-overdue tickets, overdue by priority, and cron job overdue.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>SMTP &#8211; Emails are sent and received using the TCP\/IP protocol known as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The administrator can define a certain email protocol for sending and receiving emails in support tickets by adding this add-on.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ban Email &#8211; The ban email function is used to prevent the user from creating new tickets. You can ban any of the user&#8217;s emails with this add-on; however, he will be unable to create new tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Private Credentials &#8211; This feature gives your tickets an additional layer of security so that users can safely enter passwords and other sensitive credentials onto the tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Email CC &#8211; Would you like to email another email address? It&#8217;s simple with the email&#8217;s CC addon. Simply choose the action, and then add the email, to perform it. A system email will also be sent to the specified email address. An exact copy of the email will be sent to the CC recipient.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Export &#8211; Exports are used to keep data on the local system. By adding this add-on, you can export any of the ticket data, like ticket detail, ticket history, etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-Language Email Templates &#8211; It allows you to create a language-based email template for all default email templates in the Majestic Support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Easy Digital Download &#8211; The Easy Digital Download (EDD) add-on offers support for both EDD, the Software Licensing add-on, and the Frontend Submission add-on. By using this add-on, your EDD clients will automatically be granted permission to submit support tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Social Login &#8211; There is no need to register in WordPress when using the Social Login addon, and guests can use their social information as login information in Majestic Support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Front-End Widgets &#8211; Widgets in WordPress allow you to add content and features to the widgetized areas of your theme, which are mostly the sidebar. However, these widget-ready areas can be in the header, footer, sidebar, below the content, and any other area in your theme. By adding this add-on, a widget is offering two default widgets: the &#8220;Latest Ticket&#8221; and &#8220;Email Notification&#8221; widgets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Envato Validation &#8211; You can only allow your legitimate clients to submit tickets using the Envato Validation addon. The addon will verify Envato licenses by requesting their Envato purchase code before enabling a user to open an issue. It provides support for one product, multiple products, and pre-products.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Desktop Notification &#8211; The desktop notifications add-on will always keep you informed of the status of your support activities. You receive immediate notification each time something occurs on your support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket History &#8211; As an admin, you&#8217;d like to know everything that happened on a ticket, from when it arrived at your help desk to how an agent reacted to it and what happened next. So, with the ticket history extension, you can see a summary of all the activities that have taken place on a ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket Auto Close &#8211; Automatic ticket closure reduces your effort to close the ticket manually. By enabling the add-on, tickets will be automatically closed after a set period or pre-defined rules, as determined by the administrator. While a ticket is open, it can also be closed based on the agent&#8217;s response.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback &#8211; By adding this add-on, you can get feedback from your users to enhance the quality of your services. This add-on allows you to automatically collect feedback responses that rate your agent\u2019s performance on a ticket. This add-on sends a feedback link after a ticket is closed. The user will click on a survey link and fill out the survey  &hellip;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",

By adding this add-on, you may add more agents and give them different permissions to make it easier for users to take action on their tickets. Additionally, agents can create, delete, close, and perform any other action given to them by the admin.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Agent Auto Assign &#8211; Ticket auto-assignment is a simple but critical process in the handling and closing of help desk tickets. When auto-assign is enabled, the ticket is assigned to an appropriate agent based on the rules.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi Forms &#8211; By using this multi-form functionality, admins, agents, and users, as well as visitors with the necessary permissions, can create different ticket forms to accommodate various request types based on user roles.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Paid Support &#8211; For using your support services, charge users. Create subscriptions based on duration, such as a monthly membership, or the number of tickets, like 10 tickets per month, or charge for each ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Time Tracking &#8211; Track the time spent on tickets in the most precise manner while also providing client and agent-level reporting. Keep a manual record of the time invested in each ticket response.  When the ticket is open in the agent&#8217;s browser track the time with a single click, and stop the time tracking with one click once the agent has finished with the ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>WooCommerce &#8211; If you have a WooCommerce store, then integrate Majestic Support with it to offer a smooth support solution. This is a must-have bridge between your WooCommerce store and Majestic Support. This means that consumers can submit tickets to report a specific order or to express any issues they may be having with the website.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Email Piping &#8211; From the comfort of an email account, create tickets or reply to them. For example, you could offer your clients a special email address like support@yourdomain.com. The emails received in this email will be converted to tickets. The add-on also contains built-in options to control how to manage responses to tickets that have been closed, unrecognized email addresses, and much more.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Merge Tickets &#8211; Hundreds of tickets have been submitted for assistance, some of which may be on the same topic and have similar questions. To provide support for each ticket with the same topic would be a waste of time. With this add-on, you can merge any of the two tickets or more with the same topic and query and provide support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket Overdue &#8211; An &#8220;overdue ticket&#8221; is one that has not been resolved or has not been responded to in a timely manner. By adding this add-on, you can set auto-overdue tickets, overdue by priority, and cron job overdue.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>SMTP &#8211; Emails are sent and received using the TCP\/IP protocol known as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The administrator can define a certain email protocol for sending and receiving emails in support tickets by adding this add-on.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ban Email &#8211; The ban email function is used to prevent the user from creating new tickets. You can ban any of the user&#8217;s emails with this add-on; however, he will be unable to create new tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Private Credentials &#8211; This feature gives your tickets an additional layer of security so that users can safely enter passwords and other sensitive credentials onto the tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Email CC &#8211; Would you like to email another email address? It&#8217;s simple with the email&#8217;s CC addon. Simply choose the action, and then add the email, to perform it. A system email will also be sent to the specified email address. An exact copy of the email will be sent to the CC recipient.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Export &#8211; Exports are used to keep data on the local system. By adding this add-on, you can export any of the ticket data, like ticket detail, ticket history, etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Multi-Language Email Templates &#8211; It allows you to create a language-based email template for all default email templates in the Majestic Support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Easy Digital Download &#8211; The Easy Digital Download (EDD) add-on offers support for both EDD, the Software Licensing add-on, and the Frontend Submission add-on. By using this add-on, your EDD clients will automatically be granted permission to submit support tickets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Social Login &#8211; There is no need to register in WordPress when using the Social Login addon, and guests can use their social information as login information in Majestic Support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Front-End Widgets &#8211; Widgets in WordPress allow you to add content and features to the widgetized areas of your theme, which are mostly the sidebar. However, these widget-ready areas can be in the header, footer, sidebar, below the content, and any other area in your theme. By adding this add-on, a widget is offering two default widgets: the &#8220;Latest Ticket&#8221; and &#8220;Email Notification&#8221; widgets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Envato Validation &#8211; You can only allow your legitimate clients to submit tickets using the Envato Validation addon. The addon will verify Envato licenses by requesting their Envato purchase code before enabling a user to open an issue. It provides support for one product, multiple products, and pre-products.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Desktop Notification &#8211; The desktop notifications add-on will always keep you informed of the status of your support activities. You receive immediate notification each time something occurs on your support.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket History &#8211; As an admin, you&#8217;d like to know everything that happened on a ticket, from when it arrived at your help desk to how an agent reacted to it and what happened next. So, with the ticket history extension, you can see a summary of all the activities that have taken place on a ticket.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Ticket Auto Close &#8211; Automatic ticket closure reduces your effort to close the ticket manually. By enabling the add-on, tickets will be automatically closed after a set period or pre-defined rules, as determined by the administrator. While a ticket is open, it can also be closed based on the agent&#8217;s response.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback &#8211; By adding this add-on, you can get feedback from your users to enhance the quality of your services. This add-on allows you to automatically collect feedback responses that rate your agent\u2019s performance on a ticket. This add-on sends a feedback link after a ticket is closed. The user will click on a survey link and fill out the survey  &hellip;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n",
