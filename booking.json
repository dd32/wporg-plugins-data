If you use the &#8216;aggregate&#8217; parameter in the Booking Calendar shortcode and wish to include only bookings, utilize the new parameter: options=&#8221;{aggregate type=bookings_only}&#8221;. For instance, in the shortcode example below, we aggregate only bookings: [bookingselect type=&#8217;3,4&#8242; aggregate=&#8217;3;4&#8242; options=&#8221;{aggregate type=bookings_only}&#8221;]  (9.8.15.10)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>9.8.14 &#8211; 9.8.0.1<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in <strong>all<\/strong> versions:\n<ul>\n<li>Find more information at this page: https:\/\/wpbookingcalendar.com\/changelog\/<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>9.8<\/h4>\n<h4>Changes in Free and Pro Versions:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Features and Improvements<\/strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Availability \/ Capacity<\/strong> engine for Booking Calendar, enhancing the booking process with dynamic loading and double booking prevention.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Significant performance boost<\/strong>, with page loading <strong>up to 78% faster<\/strong> and SQL requests reduced by up to 89%.<\/li>\n<li><strong>New Dark Theme<\/strong> Option: Seamlessly integrate your booking form into your website&#8217;s design with the Dark Theme, which automatically selects the appropriate calendar and time picker skins while adjusting colors for various UI elements. Activate it on Settings General page in Form Options section.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Booking Confirmation Section:<\/strong> Introduced a new Booking Confirmation section that provides users with a summary of their booking details, making it easy for users to confirm their reservations after completing the booking process. This feature allows users to quickly review essential booking information. &#8216;Booking confirmation&#8217; section located on the Booking &gt; Settings General page.
